Dear Listeners, Music-lovers, and Dance Aficionados,
Welcome back to the second ""G.I. DISCO"" mixtape!If you are new to the story or missed volume one, we recommend listening to our ""G.I. Disco Mixtape For Beginners"" and reading its
liner notes. 
Some of you (probably mainly the younger folks), may be wondering why we have divided the new mix tape into two parts.Our intent is to re-introduce a very common album concept of the late 70s and 80s to you - first side for dancing, and second for romancing.Music was released on vinyl or cassettes back then and a record/cassette naturally came with two of them. When you were through with dancing to side A, you simply flipped over to side B the “romancing side” or visa versa. You also could put your turntable on repeat and continue dancing or whatever you chose to do while listening to the romancing side (wink, wink).In case you’re wondering what a ""romancing side"" aka “slow jams” is, and their affiliation to something like ""G.I. Disco"" and/or club music history allow us the explain:
Back in the 70s and 80s there was nothing wrong with being a little “romantic” so it was essential that every DJ spin some “slow jams” during their club set.
We would like to enlighten you as to how the listening
experience felt before CD’s were introduced and how the Zeitgeist was during this time.Also lets take a moment to enhance your knowledge of how both music and music production was impacted, and how the big “Funk Bands” of the 70s successfully updated their sound. They accomplished this several ways: 
First by introducing new technology i.e. drum machines and or electronic drum sets, synthetized basslines to tight brass sections and rhythm guitars.The second was utilizing Synthesizer hits to compliment accompanying instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Flute and Piano. 
Phenomenon’s called ""one hit wonders"" appeared on the club music scene and often gained success commercially shortly there after.What made them unique was their use of the new technology as opposed to traditional instruments.Don’t assume this made arranging and production nearly as easy to do as in modern times with the advancement of computers, software, and memory. It took skills and patience to perfect sounds and program the patterns. Most of the gear used for was costly for the average musician, and there was still a lot of analogue outboard gear i.e. hardware effect- and dynamic processors and mixing desks/mic preamps needed.Next came the assistance of an able audio and recording engineer and last but certainly not least - expensive studio time and audio tape reels.If some of these technological terms are foreign to you don’t worry the objective is for you to understand what lies behind music production.
Unto the musical side of the spectrum.
Singers as well as musicians had to perform with what is referred to as “ near perfect pitch and tempo” during the recording process as there was no such thing as ""auto tune"" yet available.The discipline was to execute their parts correctly the FIRST TIME, which now due to modern technology is often compromised.There were no hard disk recorders or function the likes of copying &amp; pasting so the recording process was arduous and manual.If one failed to finish recording or mixing within the scheduled time, pictures needed to be taken of the mixing board and corresponding outboard gear settings in able to resume.
There were a number of smaller challenges also. For example, analogue synthesizers often tended to go out of tune with time, so they often needed to be recalibrated.
In 1983 Yamaha introduced the legendary and affordable DX7 synthesizer, which eliminated tuning issues as it was completely digital.
It had a glassy simulated Fender Rhodes sound that quickly replaced the traditional analogue Rhodes and associated electric pianos.For example, you can hear it in nearly all Whitney Houston ballads. It also came with very strong lead solo sounds that were in fact so fresh that even rock bands started using it from time to time in place of traditional lead guitar ie. Van Halen´ssong ""Jump"".Once the MIDI protocol was introduced it madeprogramming, arranging sequenced patterns and, controlling sounds a bit easier.However it was and still to this day is not infallible.A typical scenario would be to do the same mix down repeatedly due to one (or several) drum machines and/or synths going out of sequence through the length of a track.
Major record companies and their A&amp;R departments knew and did their jobs back then.This knowledge enabled them to allow an Artists ample time to develop a sound and a fan base which often took a few years to accomplish.If by chance an A&amp;R person failed to recognize and in turn sign a great song before it was released on one of those many independent disco labels, he made sure to close the deal on it.This was commonly the case upon witnessing a crowds reaction on the dance floor.
We realize this has been a lot to take in but, if possible take note of the aforementioned while listening to the NEW G.I. DISCO mix tape especially before you accuse some of the songs of being dated and or ""cheesy"".For instance applying heavy amounts of reverb on bass drums and baselines was the norm back then and may from a modern day point be considered excessive.Music as with all things is in constant transformation so who knows what the future holds.For those of you whose interest we have managed to spark, we have set up a YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/gidiscoberlin . We have also included a ""G.I. Doku"" play list with some videos that provide additional historical information.If would like you to contribute or be updated on events, please check out our website and blog
www.gidisco.com and our G.I. DISCO Facebook page.We hope you enjoy the new mixtape as much as the last one.
Keep an open mind…

""Growing Up With Shanghai"" is a series of soundwalks of young Shanghainese that were born and raised during the rapid modernization of their city in the 80s and 90s. These recordings not only capture their most intimate memories of the locations where they grew up but also give a snap shot of Shanghai as it sounds like now. All dialog is in Shanghainese or their local dialect. A book with uncompressed audio, translations, and photos will be available in December.

<b>[Sounds of Shanghai]</b> is a project we began in order to bring Shanghai to the world. Where natives of shanghai as well as visitors can hear the typical sounds of life in and around different locations of the largest city in China. Each recording featured here is what we think recreates the feeling, object, and experience of each location. The recordings are recorded on professional equipment and are best when listened to on headphones.
  
  <i>— Terence LLoren, Bivouac</i>

Shanghai’s name derives from its elevated position by the sea, yet its strategic position at the Yangtze River has most significantly shaped the city, spelling out a rich heritage of trade between the East and West.
    Teetering on two sides of the Cultural Revolution (the opulence reached in the 1920s-1930s and the meteoric development of the past two decades), Shanghai stands as a symbol of its many influences and capacity for countless experiences. Its overwhelming architecture and continuously morphing skyline tower over ancient vestiges of traditional living, providing an astonishing scope of historic proportions. Dubbed the ‘whore of the Orient’, Shanghai will certainly seduce you, though its richest treasures are ultimately priceless.

Collection of tracks made during latest LA visit. A short radio loop, a made-on-the-plane jam and a late nite (early morning?) headphone beat. Just having fun exploring the soul of the OP-1.

Basically first time I got to see some of the city, and not just all Anaheim trade show vibes. Easy to feel at home in LA I think. A special thanks to everyone I met! See y'all soon again!

Shortinfo: 

The Stone Tape EP is the fourth record in Session Victim's Pen & Paper series and sees Matthias Reiling's first solo outing for the vinyl only imprint.
Three original cuts betray Reiling's fascination with the mystic and occult, elevating the listener's perception and sending dancers into a spiritual and physical seance.
Fellow Sorcerer Leafar Legov's coproduction and Erobique's enchanting Melodica on Tarot Nouveau and Ouija Dub add more layers of depth and an extra set of black magic spells to the whole.
On top of that, italian beatsmith Broke One stuns everyone at Pen & Paper with his remix of the title track ""Vibrate"", boosting the original with an intense rhythm section and finally lighting up it's dark path with warm and hopeful harmonies."	457102	all		1139168905	playlist		2020-10-03T14:06:46Z	all-rights-reserved	18	False	matthias-reiling-the-stone	https://soundcloud.com/sessionvictim/sets/matthias-reiling-the-stone	True				1		public		Matthias Reiling - The Stone Tapes EP - P&P04	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1139168905	278		False	2020-10-03T14:06:17Z	2020-10-03T14:06:17Z	4	630996768,630994821,626358483,624649062

For several months I learned to listen to music in my head and remembered the television game, called Field of Miracles (the Russian Wheel of Fortune), or rather I remembered the sound of the wheel spinning; this is a cult TV program in Russia.
Having returned from rehabilitation we got down to business. We took samples from this program, some changed beyond recognition, some rethought. We recorded this release with a balearic mood, despite the fact that at that moment it was winter and there were severe frosts.”

Label Release info: 

We’re proud to announce something of an all-star cast on this new release from long-standing Delusions duo Session Victim. Continuing to impress and build a seriously loyal and devoted fanbase around the world through their impeccable DJ sets, live show and release and remixes, 2018 has been another stellar year and 2019 looks set to be even stronger. Recent artists to receive the SV Midas touch include KiNK, Folamour and Nebraska and their recently launched vinyl-only label Pen & Paper has already caused a stir since its inception this year, and only three releases in.

On their latest EP, Session Victim bring us the fruits of some heady, late- night jam sessions in their Hamburg studio, calling on their neighbour Erobique for Rhodes duties on Dawn as well as close friends Iron Curtis and Nebraska who bring their own twist to the organic and dubby SV sound. Title track Dawn featuring Nebraska builds on a loose percussive house groove, layering up reversed guitar hits and string chords to form a dense and seductive mood to get lost in.

The Taste Of Life goes on a blunted, jazzy excursion where their beloved Juno 106 takes centre stage and live drums bring a mellow yet dynamic and driving...

　昨年リリースされた『Compositions4』で、その揺るぎないヒップホップ・プロダクションのオリジナリティーと進（深）化を魅せつけたDJ SpinnaとJoc Maxが織り成すヒップホップ／ソウルの世界が余す事無く詰め込まれた作品になっている。
　 
　一聴してSpinnaのものと体感できるバウンシーなビートと鮮やかなキーボードワークが光るビート・インスト「Domecrackers Intro」から幕開ける本作。
　続く「A2」では、D'Angeloの最新アルバム『Black Messiah』でもその大きな影響が話題になったSly & The Family Stoneの71年の傑作『There's A Riot Goes On』収録のハートウォームなソウル／ファンクの名曲「Running Away」をカヴァー。Reggie Bによるヴォーカル、Miles Bonnyによるトランペットを交えた原曲への敬意を感じさせる生演奏のアプローチと、Joc Maxによるドライブ感のあるビート、Spinnaならではの高揚感に溢れるソウル・エレクトリックなアレンジが融合し、素晴しいカヴァーに仕上がっている。　
　タイトに跳ねたビートに、ジャジーなピアノ・リフレイン、グルーヴィーなキーボード／シンセ、Reggie Bによる淡く伸びやかなソウル・ヴォーカルがFeatされ、メロー・エッセンシャルな80'sソウル的なヴァイブに溢れた世界を繰り広げる「Out Of This World」も、このEPのハイライトと呼ぶに相応しい名曲。
　B-Sideは、Joc Maxによるドラム、ベース、ギター・リフの織り成す漆黒のビート／グルーヴ、ブラックポエット的なフロウがリズミカルに呼応するヒップホップ「Go On」からスタート。
　ピアノのリフレインを軸にした90'sフレイバーを感じさせるタイトなビート／グルーヴに、Reggie BとJoc Maxxが黒く鮮やかなヒップホップ・ソウルの世界が繰り広げる「Martian Man」は、後半からのムーグ系キーボードのソロもヤバい仕上がり。
  そして密室型のエレクトリック・ファンク的なトリップ感に溢れるDJ Spinnaによるビート・インスト「Outro」で幕を閉じる。

Thirteen years ago, while Jerome Derradji was Djing in Liverpool, he was approached by a young lad named Andy Ash. 

Andy handed Jerome a CD. It was so great that all the tunes ended up on “Carnival De L’Spirit”,  his (now legendary) debut  D12” for Stilove4music.

In the last decade,  Andy has been releasing critically acclaimed House and Disco 12”s on some of the best labels on the planet such as On The Prowl, Delusions of Grandeur, Dessous, People Must Jam and many others.

Finally on March 29th,  Andy will drop “Not At Home”, his first (official) full length on Still Music.

In more than a decade, Andy’s production has matured and evolved. It is now more sonically subtle, 
superbly arranged and it seamlessly brings you straight to Detroit, Chicago and New York with the perfect blend of Disco, Garage, Acid and House.

“Not At Home” is a fantastic DLP with 6 songs that showcase how much Andy has mastered his craft while staying true to his roots. This is how real house music sounds like.

To top it off, Andy, who is also a fantastic painter, created his own artwork which perfectly matches his music. (Fans of Keith Haring will not be disappointed….) 

With “Not At Home” Andy demonstrates incredible maturity, creativity and talent.

As usual, this release is limited to 500 copies on vinyl.

Support from Kristian - AME, Marsel Delsin, Patrick Perring (Slothboogie Records), Mathieu Schreyer (KCRW).

In a need for contemporary conversations with deeply admired artists , it has become a necessity to add a new imprint to the family of legendary labels founded by Jerome Derradji.

Still Techno is tailored to expose the artistry of known or unknown Techno producers throughout the world. 

Our first release is from absolute Detroit  techno legend and long time friend, Mark Flash.

Mark Flash is an essential member of the Underground Resistance collective and a vital member of Galaxy 2 Galaxy, Timeline and Depth Charge with Mike Banks.

It is an absolute honor to have Mark launch our new label with his 4 track EP “Alkebulan”. 

This EP is an incredible set  of contemporary Detroit techno.

The title track “Alkebulan” is  a fantastic world hybrid tech joint. 

With “Dementia”  and  “Centraal Station”, Mark is honing back to familiar territories with productions  reminiscent of his UR roots.

Release/catalogue number: des112
Release date: Dec 3, 2012 

Langenberg has been busy releasing his distinctive brand of knowledgeable deepness for well over half a decade now. As co-founder of the Essen-based label Mild Pitch, the man otherwise knows as Max Heesen has been responsible for some sublime moments in house, both on his own label, and for imprints such as Liebe*Detail, Drumpoet Community and Poker Flat.

Here, Desseous Recordings get their hands on the sumptuous release The Finisher. Informed and influenced by the classic Detroit sound, Langenberg produces yet another exceptional transmission. The title track is a smooth like liquid gold, yet contains a dub-tinged techno edge reminiscent of Langenberg’s Ribn project with Manuel Tur. The soulful piano interplay is pure Detroit meets Essen, and combines to produce one of the year’s standout moments.

Next up is Wait State, a bouncing groove featuring Langenberg’s trademark crisp drums and percussion, and a fantastic revolutionary vocal sample.

Sun and Sorrow is on a more driving tip, but maintains a familiar minor key motor city deepness. Also present here as a digital bonus is Sun and Sorrow Dub, an essential rework and a dub-wise dancefloor excursion for the heads.

From club DJ to bedroom producer and streaming DJ. World on a wire („Welt Am Draht“). 
Dutch duo Tunnelvisions strip things back with a hypnotic bassline on Budakid’s WALKMAN Remix.
Gerd Janson dips ZEUS by the wonderfully wordly Swiss collective Sirens Of Lesbos into his cauldron of ‘80s Italo disco synth wizardry.
Panthera Krause transforms THE AMERICAN by french artists O.N.O &  Jabberwocky into a high-energy, italy-disco dancefloor weapon. 
Biesmans pushes the button marked ‘Full Italo’ and sets the feel-good dial to ‘11’ on his spunky remix of CIAO by Enduro Disco, pitching wiggling bass arpeggios against triumphant chords, deft ‘80s drums and spine-tingling melody. 
Osunlade’s Yoruba Soul mix of HIGH TOWER by James Curd is typically classy, stripping things back down to a soulful lilt with shimmering synth arps and tumbling bongos decking out a succinct, warm, beautiful arrangement.
Enduro Disco’s LUV ME MORE balances tumbling percussive elements with a sexy bass throb and a bouncing, delicate synth line to beautiful effect.
Original Panoramabar resident, Robert Johnson and Permanent Vacation recording artist Masssimilano Pagliara provides a masterful rework of STREET VIOLENCE by swedish artist NEAT, cooking up a flurry of melodic beauty.
French dance music royalty Yuksek amps up the bass funk on his remix of MODERN DANCE by O.N.O, slides in some gentle acid tones and generally pumps the whole thing up. 
GOOD TIMES ROLL by dutch duo T.U.R.F. builds a foundation of chunky beats around some sweet jazz-funk vibes, with dashes of sax and clavinet interpersing the piledriver bassline.
IT IS U by NEAT echoes the deepest of classic progressive house with its plaintive feel, building through bobbing arpeggios and crystalline chimes while a chugging Italo disco-esque groove pushes it forward.   
TRY A LITTLE HARDER by Enduro Disco rocks a spacey disco groove where descending, detuned bass notes tumble over delayed string hits and hypnotic motifs.
GET READY by Phonk D teases with warped piano before unleashing a loose funk b-line and dubby vocal snippets.
DANCING IN HONG KONG by Romain FX provides a a cute little ‘80s electro-funk jam where jaunty keys, organ bass and a little city pop vibe rub up against each other.
All in all this is a great eclectic dance compilation. Too bad you could not enjoy the music in the club. But we hope you can at least enjoy it at home."	4893102	all		1180611724	playlist		2020-12-18T14:40:14Z	all-rights-reserved	7	False	shir-khan-presents-welt-am	https://soundcloud.com/shirkhan/sets/shir-khan-presents-welt-am	True			2020-12-18T00:00:00Z	1		public		Shir Khan Presents Welt Am Draht 2020 I Exploited	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1180611724	334		False	2020-12-18T14:37:08Z	2020-12-18T14:37:08Z	13	944242816,944242792,944242750,944242681,944242633,944242612,944242567,944242522,944242489,944242423,944242360,944242300,944229115

A loose disco cut, Mingo’s ‘You Can’t Rave In A Buffalo Herd’ follows from the Hamburg resident’s ‘Sunscreen’ bomb on ‘Black Jukebox Disco House Jam Vol. 2’ last year. A filtered disco groove rises from the depths with snappy beats in support and slow phasers drenching it in waves of psych goodness. It suddenly explodes into a funked-up, soulful frenzy that is guaranteed to get fists pumping on the dancefloor. Is it summer already?
The second cut on this hot release comes from another German city: Kassel. Manolo Bronson & Zoka connect here for another slinky groove in the form of ‘Velvet Coat’. Zoka is well known on the local scene for his work booking DJs for local hotspots A.R.M. and Club Unten over the years, and he is an increasingly impressive force in the studio. Together they cook up another feel-good cut based around sweet guitar licks and vibrant live bass, with gentle Latin percussion and melancholy electric piano motifs winding their way around the meat of the track. A triumphant disco string assemblage tops the track off for a rousing finale.

2019 closes with a selection of 14 Exploited tracks that went down like a storm. 
There is Dutch youngster Budakid who impressed with 3 releases for Exploited this year in the form of Adieu X, No Strings Attached and The End, label longstay Joyce Muniz who teamed up with Little Boots on Strange Girl in the remix treatment by Black Loops, Swedish newcomers NEAT who stand out with a sound all of its own that you’d be hard pressed to pin down, disco and house newbies T.U.R.F., old friend The Mekanism with a gentle summer jam, James Curd with 2 outstanding dancefloor bombs in the remix by Sandboards (Feel My Bicep) and Bas Roos, producer legend Arthur Baker and not to forget Enduro Disco with three tracks that vibrantly manifest his modern disco desires.
All in all this is a great eclectic dreamy dance compilation by one of the leading deephouse labels out there.

2018 closes with a selection of 14 Exploited tracks that went down like a storm.

There is dreamy indie-dance styled vocals cuts and melodic techno from GHEIST…

Kyodai channeling the spirit of African Rhythm with uplifting female vocals soaring over muted, plucked instrumentation and tuned percussive hits…

Joyce Muniz’s electro-infused techno production, where jagged synth arpeggios rub up against her sharp snappy percussion and bass hovers menacingly below…

T.U.R.F.’s disco-house sample invasion…

James Curd’s dirty Chicago Loft Party…

Ossie’s pumping house workout, flexing with weighty garage bass…

Yarni & Javi’s orchestral sounds, field recordings and balearic tropical house…

and many more great tunes keeping things eclectic !

Parallel 9 - Helix/Gnosis - Delsin Records - dsr-stc2

Two iconic Parallel 9 dub-techno classics from the Steve Rachmad archives re-issued on the Delsin Sterac series. Originally released in 1995 on Prime, now re-mastered in 2021 fashion.

Steve Rachmad’s richly melodic strain of techno has resulted in a huge body of work he has been growing since the early 90s. His sound is the perfect distillation of machine soul – dubby atmospherics and crisp, danceable dynamics balanced in perfect unison. Amsterdam’s Delsin Records gathers together some of the Dutch techno figurehead’s most important, sought-after works in a new EP series, all remastered from the original DAT tapes from Steve’s archives.

Adding to the weight of this series, the accompanying artwork is being created by Boris Tellegen, aka legendary graffiti artist Delta who first began designing sleeves with Secret Life Of Machines. Since then he created many works for labels including Delsin.

Jayson Wynters - The Affect Heuristic - Delsin Records - 147dsr

Delsin welcomes Jayson Wynters into the fold for a four-track EP that embodies techno as a vibrant, expressive artform with the ability to uplift. The Birmingham-based producer’s sound champions impulse and feeling over perfectionism. He’s not afraid to push the synths into the red and get some dirt on the drums, conjuring up a feeling more akin to the grit and grime of real life than sterile, perfectionist production.

Wynters has already slipped out releases on Don’t Be Afraid, Phoenix G and Ornate Music, erring towards deeper strains of hardware-oriented house and techno but also displaying an instinct for broader tempos and rhythms. He’s got the vocabulary to rush at 140 and break up the beats as much as lock into a steady, heady roller.

On The Affect Heuristic, Wynters strides forth with his electrifying machine language which calls to mind the feverish, psychedelic tweaking and layering of visionaries like Dan Curtin and Lee Purkis (In Sync). The style shifts from track to track, leading with the cascading arps and rowdy leads of ‘Trace Minerals’ before swerving towards the springy electro-techno of ‘The Hunted’. ‘Crypto’ plots a darker, faster course into a vivid soundchasm sculpted out of low-passed impulses and spectral synth shapes. ‘Tehutis Law’ brings a distinct Motor City funk, loaded with wiggling accents to the groove from the bottom end right up to the high frequencies.

Wynters’ touch is highly developed, cast in technicolour, and it sounds incredibly rich in your ear, but it’s the rawness of the feeling which makes this an important addition to the long and winding legacy of techno music. The artwork – a canny meld of bold geometry, bright colours and rough textures from Jeroen Erosie (3024), Erris Huigens (Graphic Surgery) and Tijl Schneider – responds to the music in a wholly appropriate way. In a field littered with polished, monochrome clones, it’s artists like Wynters that truly shine."	1905449	all	Electronic	1300675216	playlist		2021-09-24T07:35:16Z	all-rights-reserved	24	True	the-affect-heuristic	https://soundcloud.com/delsinrecords/sets/the-affect-heuristic	True	Buy		2021-09-24T00:00:00Z	7		public		The Affect Heuristic	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1300675216	352	ep	True	2021-09-24T00:00:00Z	2021-09-24T00:00:00Z	4	1104990016,1104989473,1104989008,1104990310

more info:

CiM returns to Delsin with a nine track LP crafted out of his personal Amiga archives. Simon Walley started off in the early 90s trying to write Amiga demo scene music. Influenced and inspired by the blossoming techno electronica sounds in the UK around that time, he tried to replicate those sounds via old school tracker techniques.

Learning through ripping modules by Romeo Knight, Audiomonster, Firefox and Mantronix from demo disks, and writing/re-writing in Protracker resulted in a unique style, creating fresh clashing beats out of tweaked Amiga samples. A 386 PC that drifted in tempo was sync’d by ear to add pads and melodies that the MIDI-less Amiga couldn’t generate. Recording most of it on the fly, fooling around in Protracker and leaving all mistakes in and un-edited. All tracks written between '96-98."	2146484	all	Electronic	1295683102	playlist		2021-09-17T09:13:10Z	all-rights-reserved	34	True	unselected-protracker-mods	https://soundcloud.com/delsinrecords/sets/unselected-protracker-mods	True	Buy		2021-09-17T00:00:00Z	7		public		Unselected ProTracker Mods	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1295683102	352	album	True	2021-09-17T00:00:00Z	2021-09-17T00:00:00Z	9	1098952810,1098952954,1098948406,1098951214,1098948637,1098951934,1098948985,1098952735,1098950326

Galvanized by heavily swung drums, loaded and coded with a venom-like trance-funk and characterized by grand  sound system melodies that tears out of nowhere and disappears just as quickly. The package on Resopal comes with remixes by Oliver Kapp and Cavaan plus a bonus track.
Cocoon's Oliver Kapp deconstructs ""Verano"" and rebuilds it into something grander, even more techno and underground based than the original. Sparse, dripping snares, warbling, fizzing drones, and haunting specters of voices phasing through the mists. Cavaan reconstructs and extends ""Verano"" into a slowly evolving minimal tech-house jam. Insistent drums and main themes are all perfectly interlocked."	503212	all	Techno	841167848	playlist		2019-08-28T07:11:00Z	all-rights-reserved	6	False	rsp-166-alles-andrs-verano-ep-vinyl-snippets	https://soundcloud.com/resopal/sets/rsp-166-alles-andrs-verano-ep-vinyl-snippets	True			2019-10-15T00:00:00Z	2		public	"RSP 166 - ALLES ANDRS VERANO EP VINYL SNIPPETS ""OLIVER KAPP"" RESOPAL CAVAAN"	RSP 166 - ALLES ANDRS - VERANO EP -  VINYL SNIPPETS	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/841167848	444		False	2019-08-19T11:09:12Z	2019-08-19T11:09:12Z	4	661823228,661823243,661823258,667921247

And the other player who also joins in on the chain is  canadian producer Nitin. Lorenzo is definitely the master of first-class reduced microhouse sounds, a classical composer and pianist with a degree from the prestigious Conservatory of Saint Cecilia in Rome. From this Lorenzo has blended Classical and Electronic music for labels such as Culprit LA, Contexterrior / Tuning Spork, Get Physical Music and more.

Digital release: 25th June 2021

A1: Voodoo
B1: Signs

@pan-pot return to their Second State imprint to serve up the label's sixth release this year. The illustrious Second State has been fostering the sound of some of techno’s biggest tastemakers and emerging artists for several years, with releases throughout 2021 so far being some of their strongest ones to date. ""Voodoo Signs"" EP however, is a shift from their usual productions, incorporating a breakbeat sound throughout the record, a step away from the duo’s familiar straight ahead techno weapons.

Hugely atmospheric and packed with conflicting elements, “Voodoo” is the punchier cut of the two tracks on the record. A palpitating muffled kick launches and is quickly joined by rapid percussion and dancing hi-hats that weave throughout the heaviness. As things develop, these turbulent elements are smoothly subdued to let doomy wails echo and build to a crescendo. The main vocal sample meshes with several other voices that ominously quaver over the original. A stabbing melody is then introduced, skittering over the foundations with broken beat drum hooks moving in unison.

On the flip side is “Signs”, a peak time fast paced club track with a driving beat. A stifled kickdrum and a singular bleating tone start things off, before the full weight of the drum is unleashed. A dark looming bass builds on top of cracking percussion and claps until it’s replaced by a distorted male vocal sample crying out “searching, searching”. In the second half, the bleating tone is pushed into the minor key and the bass looms, menacingly. The kick drum returns while the vocal sample becomes increasingly distorted until it fades out. A breakbeat cuts through the noise, switching up the energy and reinstating the hectic, club atmosphere.

A1: Pan-Pot - Keid
B1: Pan-Pot - Planet9
B2: Pan-Pot - Echoes From Epsilon

As the pandemic continues to put a halt on clubbing as we knew it, techno dons Pan-Pot have adapted their sound to suit these uncertain times. The dancefloor focus remains, but on their latest EP,  there’s a restraint and delicacy to the tracks that reveals yet another facet of the duo’s creativity, and innate understanding of what their fans want to hear right now.

“Keid” builds slowly with rustling percussion, insistent tapping and a sneaky, smouldering bassline that bypasses the predictable massive drop for something moodier and more subtle. Exotic jungle sounds, tribal drums and cool bleeps open the atmospheric “Planet9”, which soon pivots towards a thrilling build and ravey arpeggios that sound ripe for dank basement clubs and open-air festivals alike. “Echoes from Epsilon” is probably the most unexpected track of the lot. Five and a half minutes of ambience is characterised by airy pads, windchime synths, and a transportative, meditative air that is light years away from Pan-Pot’s typical fare.

At once timeless and completely of the moment, Keid is a surprising, refreshing release from the industry veterans that should both please old fans and win new ones.

7: Pan-Pot - Confronted (Pan-Pot Paradise Remix)

Ten years ago, Berlin’s Pan-Pot put out the Confronted EP on Mobilee, a landmark release centred around the title track, eleven and a half minutes of slow-burning techno. A decade later, the Second State dons have decided to celebrate their classic track with a reissue that reflects their evolution. Featuring three remixes from Pan-Pot themselves, Tassilo Ippenberger and Thomas Benedix have also recruited four of the scene’s hottest talents for a diverse, comprehensive remix package that reimagines the source material for today’s dancefloors.

Opening up the remix package, the “Basement” remix by Pan-Pot adds barking synths and snatches of vocal FX in a murky, offbeat edit of the classic. Glaswegian rising star Frazi.er delivers a “Raw”, lean techno tool with subtle tweaks like the crystalline synths piping through the mix and aggressive, springy bass that charges in mid-way through. Farrago, a Lenske favourite from Belgium, takes the listener on a weirder journey built around bounces, bleeps and discombobulation – it’s by far the most foreign departure on the EP and it lives up to the “Welcome to Goa” title.

The “Up In The Air” remix by Pan-Pot removes the pounding kick and turns the mood tribal with steel drums and rubbery, muted basslines. It’s a housier cut well suited to wonky wigouts. French newcomer [ Wex 10 ] takes care of the “Bigroom” remix, ushered in by an outsized, unapologetic kick soon joined by the original’s ominous chords and the cool, detached female vocal. [ Wex 10 ] picks up the BPM, adds some snare rolls and turns in a fist-pumping version for festivals and superclubs. Up-and-comer Anfisa Letyago, from Naples by way of Siberia, sends a rippling acid synth through the mix like lightning in a hi-NRG alternative perfect for trancier sets in her “Stranger” remix. The word “crazy” is set on an electrifying loop, commanding ravers to give in and let go.

Closing the remix EP, the “Paradise” remix by Pan-Pot goes in the opposite direction, opening with bird calls and idyllic chiming synths before moving into breaksy territory. Surprising and strangely dreamy, it completes a richly varied remix package that breathes new life into a beloved classic.

1: Pan-Pot – Solace
2: Pan-Pot – Consequence
3: Pan-Pot – Lose Yourself
4: Pan-Pot – Lose Yourself (Marcel Fengler Remix) [digital only]

After nearly a year since their sophomore album 'The Other', Pan-Pot return home to Second State with a stunning EP showcasing the duos proficiency for composing dynamic, cutting-edge Techno.
Over the span of three tracks, 'Solace' EP navigates through a trifecta of distinct styles that unquestionably bear the mark of Pan-Pot's masterstroke. Kicking it off at a breakneck pace is the title track 'Solace' with rapid fire low end and intense tones laying the bedrock for a wildly uplifting presentation of keys creating the ideal balance between opposing forces.
Up next is 'Consequence' which see the duo team up with Martin Eyerer for a newly styled trip down memory lane. By pairing key elements of the sounds of early Pan-Pot and contemporary production, the trio have succeeded in conceiving a fever inducing, big room hit.
Rounding out the EP is 'Lose Yourself' and it is by far the most grandiose of the trilogy. Lush pads and soaring sonic stairs build toward a zenith as the ceaseless chant of ""lose yourself"" escorts the traveller through an elated dream.
To top it all off, Pan-Pot personally enlisted the expertise of IMF's label boss, the mighty Marcel Fengler. With an astute awareness, Fengler weaves the original artifacts of ‘Lose Yourself' into a truly unique orchestration of rugged percussion and euphoric abstraction.
Although it's been a year since we last saw Pan-Pot on Second State, once you experience 'Solace', we think you'll agree, it's good to have the bosses back home.

Currently carving their own signature into the dense, sprawling techno landscape with Second State Audio, the German two-man-machine that is Pan-Pot take a breather from their own label Second State and apply their slick dancefloor science to Nicole Moudaber's MOOD imprint. And while the titles might enjoy a light-hearted play on words, the sounds themselves are straight-up peak time, no-messing techno constructions.

""Win Some"" is the ultimate DJ jewel: laced clever layers of percussion and a pneumatic sub/kick relationship, this just rolls and rolls into infinity with heads-down energy and a dynamic that's ideal for deep, deep mix blends.
""Lose Some"" plays the perfect foil as it chats with a slightly housier sonic syntax before going absolutely loco midway with a paranoid synth scribble that disappears as quickly as it flashes into the mix, creating that trippy blink-and-miss sensation that electrify the best sets when precision dropped.

Win some, lose some… The perfect Techno yin and yang, the ultimate balance of shades and, just maybe, an allegory for life itself: Everything goes up and down, our experience on this planet is in a constant state of flux. However you wish to interpret their concept, be sure to dig deep and reflect life's rich balance with these two on-point MOOD-release gems.

332		2019-02-21T07:44:42Z	"One of Stockholms finest beatmakers presents a massive four tracker 
of deep house under his Carl Borg pseudonym.

Carl started making electronic music at the age of 14. He found his way into 
house music after buying an Yamaha A3000 sampler, sampling through his 
friends and parents vinyl collections. In 2004 he started to tour through Europe, 
South Africa and Russia together with Forss (Eric Wahlforss) as Forss Versus Borg. 
Playing live-sets consisting of both up-tempo house tracks and experimental glitchy 
electronica. Carls debut release, the classic 12 inch Splinter Body Scene EP, 
was released on German label Sonar Kollektiv during that same time. Since then 
he has released several EPs, remixes and produced a number of original soundtracks 
throughout the years. Carl played an important part of the band project S.F.B. 
(Stoner, Forss, Borg), a fusion of acoustic jazz and live electronica, in 2006. 
The project resulted in the album “The Lektor Tapes” on Gothenburg based label 
Hoob Records.

Inside Switch EP is Carls follow-up to recently released Hidden Focus EP on 
Swedish Brandy Productions. The opening track ”Inside Switch” is an uplifting 
90’s house trip with dubby soul vocals, lush synth chords and a solid Moog-driven 
bass line. The follow-up ”Concordia” is a deeper Detroit-influenced track, 
with an irresistible rolling bass line and large jazzy rhodes chords.

On the flip side, ”The Serious Game” is a perfect dance floor heater. A bouncy 
club track with sampled strings, massive piano stabs and wild dubbed out build-ups. 
The EP rounds off with ”Just Promises”, a techy groover with hypnotic organ stabs, 
warm string pads and a vintage-sounding vocal hook on top.

Inside Switch EP is Carls first 12 inch release on Swedish Brandy Productions."	1395015	all	Carl Borg	713728041	playlist		2019-03-25T14:32:29Z	all-rights-reserved	27	False	carl-borg-inside-switch-ep-new	https://soundcloud.com/swedishbrandyproductions/sets/carl-borg-inside-switch-ep-new	True				5		public	"""Inside Switch EP"" ""Swedish Brandy Productions"" ""Deep House"""	"Carl Borg - Inside Switch EP - NEW 12"" VINYL - OUT NOW!"	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/713728041	524		False	2019-02-21T07:44:42Z	2019-02-21T07:44:42Z	4	578858970,578858961,578858958,578858922

Since the late 1990s, Greg and Shane's production work under the Fish Go Deep name has travelled far and wide. After an early Series of EPs on New Jersey's seminal i! Records, more than fifty releases have followed on labels as  influential and diverse as Innervisions, Local Talk, Freerange, Nite Grooves, Large Music and Om Records.
 
In late 2005 their own Go Deep imprint got off to a flying start when the first release, The Cure and the Cause, with vocalist Tracey K, was licensed by UK house giant, Defected, and became a huge club and chart hit. Since then they have released more than two dozen EPs on Go Deep, Ork and other labels and have remixed a wide variety of house  luminaries  -  Kerri Chandler, Alton Miller, Audio Soul Project, Charles Webster and Jamie Anderson feat. K-Alexi, among others.
 
In 2012 the duo released their second album, Draw The Line, to widespread acclaim and worldwide radio and club support. So Far So
Deep Volume One, a compilation of Fish Go Deep productions and remixes, followed in 2014 and further releases and remixes have
appeared on labels such as Freerange and Atjazz Music Company in recent years. In 2017, their Large Music release,  Baby Tell Me,
finished the year as one of the top ten deep house sellers on the influential Traxsource download store. Releases scheduled for
2018 include EPs for Nite Grooves, Seasons, Large and Swedish Brandy Productions."	1682543	all	Fish Go Deep	639187725	playlist		2019-04-10T09:54:08Z	all-rights-reserved	25	False	fish-go-deep-drip-down-ep-12	https://soundcloud.com/swedishbrandyproductions/sets/fish-go-deep-drip-down-ep-12	True				5		public	"""Swedish Brandy Productions"" ""Drip Down EP"" Vinyl"	"FISH GO DEEP - DRIP DOWN EP - 12"" VINYL - OUT NOW!"	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/639187725	524		False	2018-11-07T18:26:03Z	2018-11-07T18:26:03Z	4	526236030,526235952,526235742,526235601

Future Dreams is the unexpected lyrical child of Future Cities and my old (2003-2008?) songs I recorded with Anna, Rocka and Jape for my heavily sample-laden ""Beginnings and Engings"" LP – that ended up not happening because, you know, samples. Better this way, I think - they seem to suit this stuff better. For some reason, probably the involvement of great musicians, I feel like this would warrant a physical release but will absolutely not be riddled with another stack of records I have to peddle, I hate selling. Oh, the dilemma. :D Anyhow, enjoy, I always enjoy making it.


The ""Future"" albums tell of the future that we were promised, a future slightly less gray, with flying cars instead of oil crises. Originally the whole thing started as a little EP ot maybe twenty minutes, dealing with my obvious obsession with sci-fi dys/utopias.

Originally the whole thing started as a little EP - the idea was to have the classic techno arrangement style (ie. growth) but without the genre itself, and to go overboard with layering - making drones or tapestries with melodies. Or, well, I wanted to do that sci-fi album. Can you blame me?
The remaining two albums are in flux ATM and all feedback is warmly welcome.

This one is Future Cities, least calm of these albums, Future Ruins ( https://music.apple.com/album/future-ruins/853807099, also here on https://soundcloud.com/polyfonken/sets/future-ruins-previews ) is the almost beat-free pastoral counterpart and for sale at digital outlets.

Back in 2017, when Keith Thompson and Rocco Rodamaal met at a party on the Hudson in New York (where Rocco was playing), both were far to imagine this encounter would shape up the beautiful project that is presented to you today. With the idea of celebrating the 30th birthday of his house classic ""Break 4 Love"" (as the lead vocalist of Raze), Keith felt that a collaboration with the respected long-running French producer would be spot on. Having freshly launched his own Memories imprint with the successful ""Someday"", Rocco suggested to record a completely new reinterpretation with Keith (instead of simply remixing it) and to release it himself.

With 2.5 million units sold worldwide and a ""stone cold"" classic status, the track looked like a ballsy move to re-approach artistically. Strong of his 20 years DJ and production career with key releases and remixes on labels such as Defected, Freerange, Classic, Atjazz Record Company and Buzzin Fly, Rocco's goal was to deliver a completely contemporary version with Keith's freshly new recorded vocals without betraying the timeless feel and original spirit of “Break 4 Love”. With friendship and loyalty being high in his book, Rocco wanted to share the experience with his friends and give the project a high dose of musicality in order to consolidate a strong message to the new listeners' generation. This is how this ""All-Stars Team"" developed naturally around the project. Alex Finkin, the musical director of Aloe Blacc, amazing multi-instrumentalist and man of many talents, co-produced and co-wrote the ""new"" “Break 4 Love” with Rocco in Paris while deep house Jedi Master Atjazz engineered the final mixdown in his studio in Derby. Being the prolific remixer & a man of spotless taste that we all know, Atjazz delivered his own splendid rendition of Rocco and Alex's new recording, excited by using the velvet voice of Keith printed in the house music history."	1571487	all	Deep House	857160185	playlist	Memories	2019-08-29T07:20:47Z	all-rights-reserved	14	False	rocco-rodamaal-ft-keith	https://soundcloud.com/roccorodamaal/sets/rocco-rodamaal-ft-keith	True	Buy & Stream	http://lnk.to/X3pjtQex		5		public	"Atjazz ""Louie Vega"" Karizma ""House Classic"""	Rocco Rodamaal Ft.

Format: Twelve inch
Label: Deeply Rooted 
Cat no: DRH053
Release date: Sept 5th.

Volume 3 on my « cuts » series on Deeply Rooted:
- « MKS1 MAIN »: A straight forward House track, the way i understand  « House » today.
- « MKS1 Dub»: A drum workout for djs! 
- « NEW HORIZONS »: Deep House as i like it today, i unintentionaly listened back to this track after hearing a Call Super jam (i’m a big fan of his work) and somehow i realized you could feel i have been very influenced by his work and sensibility on this one.
- « NEW HORIZONS DUB»: A straighter and little bit more minimal dj friendly version.

▶Andy Roda presents Alex Scuderi and the remixes of his debut single “I Feel The Same”. A showcase of Roda's versatility as a prolific writer/producer who has reconstructed the 'Original Mix' (a Giorgio Moroder / 80's Synth inspired track with Scuderi on the vocals) into two new versions. The 'Deep Dub' is a sexy club banger rooted in the deep and soulful New York house sound Roda came up with, while the 'Emotech Mixes' reflect the influence of Berlin through a beautifully haunting melodic and techno track, articulated by dramatic strings, hypnotic synths, and a pulsating bass that keeps evolving, while Alex Scuderi's seductive baritone voice is summoning the dance floor, to transcend with him into a beautiful state of bliss.

Island regulars Federico Grazzini and Remo combine forces under the alias and ready their debut release, The Secret. 

Driving, tribal-tinged tech house, oldschool synth, vocal and crisp percussion characterise the Club Mix, whilst their Dub version materialised from a live recordings session and takes a deeper yet equally potent path. 

On the remix Spanish talent Leix reworks The Secret with a raw, dark flair, giving a techno touch that perfectly completes the package."	467399	all	House,Techno	15970766	playlist		2013-11-30T20:41:17Z	all-rights-reserved	0	False	lair-the-secret-tenax	https://soundcloud.com/djremo/sets/lair-the-secret-tenax	True	null	http://www.beatport.com/release/the-secret/1197894		0		public	Lair Remo Federico Grazzini Leix Tenax	Lair - The Secret - Tenax Recordings	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/15970766	770	ep	True		2013-11-30T20:35:05Z	0

Released October 3rd on Endless, ""Secret World"" is Luca Bacchetti's debut album. The work summarizes and amplifies the last 15 years of his activity and career as a visionary artist able to meander through all forms of electronic music, without compromise. Luca references the many lived experiences he has had around the world, but first and foremost ""Secret World"" is a testament to his love for his homeland, Tuscany.

Now @MathiasSchober, @InigoVontier, @Stefano-Onorati and @LucaBacchetti himself reinterpret some of the more representative songs from the album, which is now valid material for the most demanding of clubs. The impeccable power and sonorous precision of Mathias Schober merge with the pathos of The Bridge: Mathias cleverly manages to combine the two elements giving the song a truly emotional cut. Unconsciously United is turned inside out and rebuilt around the rhythmic world of Inigo Vontier, our favourite Mexican, whose touch can be felt with breaks and arpeggios that will make the dance-floors explode. Luca Bacchetti is as ever a guarantee, providing Black Swan with a powerful groove on which psychedelia and hypnotic elements alternate, benefitting from the arrangement and breaks: his unmistakable trademarks. Stefano Onorati, already a collaborator on Secret World, sets off on a completely different direction, the Tuscan pianist transforms Awakenings into an ambient masterpiece. Lower the background noise, Stefano goes deep and will excite you from the very first listen."	1636127	all		957016729	playlist	ENDLESS	2020-01-09T22:31:00Z	all-rights-reserved	22	False	luca-bacchetti-secret-world-2	https://soundcloud.com/lucabacchetti/sets/luca-bacchetti-secret-world-2	True		http://lnk.to/SecretWorldRemixes	2020-01-08T00:00:00Z	4		public	"""luca bacchetti"" ""mathias schober"" ""inigo vontier"" ""stefano onorati"" ""secret world remixe"""	Luca Bacchetti 'Secret World Remixes' ENDLESS 033	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/957016729	876		False	2020-01-01T06:34:38Z	2020-01-01T06:34:38Z	4	739738435,738693313,736384894,740993860

Chicago. Detroit. New York. London. Tuscany. The beautiful Italian region conjures up many impressions: the timeless artworks and architecture of Florence, the fresh flavours of the food and wine produced in its lush landscape, even the famous white Carrara marble that’s dug from the ground and exported around the world. But probably the last thing you’d associate it with is electronic music. Until now.

Luca Bacchetti’s debut album “SECRET WORLD” is a work almost 15 years in the making. It’s also one that required the endlessly touring DJ to traverse the world numerous times before an inner call came to return home to Italy to record it. Having earned a reputation for crafting club cuts, a fact underlined by releases on the world’s most recognisable labels, from Wagon Repair, Ovum, Mule Musiq, All Day I Dream, Crosstown Rebels, Culprit to Defected and his own @Endless-Worldwide imprint, it’s a radical sonic departure. But it’s one that reflects both his homecoming and the journey to get there. ”With this, I entered a new world I’ve never shown before,” he says.

After spending ten years between Italy and Barcelona, his bases to play everywhere from Tokyo’s Womb to DC10 in Ibiza, in 2017 he moved back to his native Tuscany. Here, at the beginning of 2018, he decamped for two weeks to a bungalow in Il Ciocco. An area of exceptional natural beauty, he was joined by friends and musicians Stefano Onorati (keyboards), Andrea Guzzoletti (trumpet) and Leo Di Angilla (percussion). All Italian, their sole intention was to capture the ineffable feeling that had drawn Luca back. “We make a living with this job and there are always compromises,” says Luca on his past experience of the music industry. “With the album I aimed to be totally free, I just followed my instinct.”

The result is a masterful vision of electronica swelling with emotional contours as majestic as the lands that inspired it. Title track “Secret World” is epic on the scale of the grand Apennines Mountains, while “Awakenings” evokes spring sunshine with soft, tentative piano. The album also captures the countries Luca has fallen in love with on his way. “Black Swan” his opening track playing for Robot Heart at last year’s Burning Man festival in Nevada, USA trips out in a squeal of psychedelic guitar. “La Ruta Del Sur” and “Fervor De Buenos Aires”, meanwhile captures the distinct melodies and rhythmic complexity of South America, and the contemplative “After The Silence” features two Balinese Rindik musicians recorded after Nyepi Day, a day of national silence.

Growing up in the tiny village of Pieve Fosciana, there were no record shops or clubs. Radio was Luca’s saviour and he followed its lure into DJing, production, then, since 2005, playing around the world. His path has encompassed a wide musical love of everything from Bristolian trip-hop to Detroit techno, but these city’s histories aren’t his own truth.

Luca’s secret world is no longer secret. You can apply the same go to adjectives to the album as used to describe Tuscany at large: ‘simple’, ‘honest’, ‘beautiful’, ‘earthy’, ‘romantic’. In the end, language fails to capture the sublime nature of his roots. Next to experiencing them directly, the closest you’ll get is “Secret World” - an alchemical transformation of the images in Luca’s head into the universal language of music.

L'histoire :
Bien décidés à quitter le onzième arrondissement de Paris, les deux Vilaines enfourchèrent leurs vélomoteurs à la recherche d'une petite blonde, histoire de célébrer le solstice d'été. La moustache bien peignée, ils se voyaient déjà en exilés volontaires à Acapulco pour une durée indéterminée. Comme d'habitude le moteur ne dépassa pas la Porte d'Aubervilliers et nos deux héros s’arrêtèrent devant le premier rade venu. Le plan vadrouille s'annonçait mal. Soudain, le baume au cœur : gainées de cuir et en talons hauts, deux petites déesses sur le parking annonçaient la victoire. Guitares dans le coffre, Alan Vega au volant, ils volèrent pour une destination inconnue....

Piccadilly Records Review :
French duo from Paris. I'll be honest, I don't know much about them (Patriiiick?!) but they've already garnered support by Chloé, David Shaw, Tim Paris, and Dombrance among others. And rightly so - this is some excellent new musica from our European friends. ""Scandale"" is both minimal and retroist, utilizing 80s drum machines (Jomox I think) with old sequencers and synths to conjure up that electronic voodoo usually saved for the Norwegian / Swedish crews of Frak, Borft, Sex Tags Mania etc. All those clever things they teach you in synthesis (glide functions, de-tune, oscillator fine tune etc) executed brilliantly and always in sympathy with the dancefloor. ""Lame De Fond"" uses equally sophisticated synthesis techniques but goes on a late night Italian-tinged theme... that is, I think - by this point the synth lines were completely infiltrating my cerebrum and I started to shut down as a human and slowly metamorphose into a robot. ""El Topo"" was the final jam I needed before ripping off all my clothes to reveal a fully chrom'd body piece. Then proceeding to strut a half-tempo robo-walk across the saloon, nodding at the cybernetic barmaid and flicking her a wink of my eye before leaving to do laser sword battle with some invader from a unwelcome star cluster.

Sys_X has been the creative core of XRS Land, with releases on Innerground, Critical and Trama. With a more synthetic edge, these tracks show some pulsating Detroit elements, with a subtle percussive latin motif for some Brazilian funkiness, yet with a cheeky techno twist. The total effect is at once hypnotic and ultimately dancefloor friendly.	3378907	all	Electronic	283578176	playlist	Tupy	2016-12-15T06:54:15Z	all-rights-reserved	8	False	sys_x-courier	https://soundcloud.com/tupy/sets/sys_x-courier	True			2016-12-15T00:00:00Z	1		public		Sys_X: Courier	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/283578176	982		False	2016-12-15T06:54:13Z	2016-12-15T06:54:13Z	9	297992801,297992790,297992785,297992781,297992776,297992775,297992771,297992768,297992765

Reaching 15 years of existence, XRS Land shows perfect integration with various dance music styles, blending breakbeat, ambient and house universes seamlessly. Dragster expresses it through the very essence of drum and bass at extreme pressure levels, in a transcending bass experience. A diversity of keys and pads float in the air, flirting with sweet vocals, XRS Land's main signature. This is definetly a collector's must-have, and a milestone for what comes next.

One day Lasse said: ""we have a gig this afternoon do you have any tunes?"" ""Sure I said.""
That's King Eriks Blues. 

It's Lasse on flugelhorn, me on piano and sorry to say I've forgotten his name on bass.
Just listen to Lasse's soulful horn! Man I miss him.

Having cropped up on Soma, Fondation and Four:Twenty with his heavily electronic house sounds in the past two years, Loraine has carved out a distinctive niche for himself. Avoiding trends and writing music he believes in is his ethos and this EP displays that excellently.
 
The EP begins with “Will Time Tell” – a melodic, electronic and melancholic slice of house which treads its own path in fine style. Each sound within has both rhythmic and musical qualities, with the interplay and overlap between the elements creating a fascinating listen.
 
‘Ditto’ follows and serves as a much more stripped back tool of a track yet is no less inventive in terms of its aesthetic, sound palette and arrangement. Odd, and with a distinctive machine funk vibe, it has bags of personality.
 
The clipped laidback house of ‘Hoo Boo & Boo Hoos’ and ‘It Matters To Me’ see Loraine build on the classic deep house template, tip a swift nod to the stripped stylings of Thomas Melchior and round up a selection of original tracks which are a refreshing break from the norm.
 
Soma’s occasionally eccentric, always on point Let’s Go Outside provide the parting shot of the EP, and do so by converting ‘Ditto’ into a brooding, cinematic and eerie slice of techno which they terms as their ‘Faded Copy Remix’.

The first track 'Feestiwal' comes with an atmospheric afro-latin beat and builds up with a catchy synth melody. 

The second track 'Koe Koe' dives into the tech house genre with a hypnotic techno beat and repeating soundscapes. The track comes with that extra overcompression feeling. Perfect for the late night clubbers out there.

Wesley Monteiro started his music career in 2004. After he learned a few chords, Wesley started to build a band with some friends, in the basement of his aunt. What started as 'a joke', became serious business in a very short time. The band got their first booking and before they knew, they had several worldwide bookings in clubs and on some big festivals.

In 2009 Wesley went to Extrema festival to watch his nephew 'Benny Rodrigues', closing the main stage and from that moment on, he was infected with house music. While he was watching 'Benny' destroying the crowd, he knew, one day he wanted to be part of it. Wesley started to create some house ideas on his Korg Triton. 

In 2011 Wesley picked up the house music again, which was the year of his first official release, a latin house track named 'Madalena'. This track was in collaboration with one of the biggest DJ and producer from the Netherlands' Gregor Salto, his uncle Anibel Fortes and Melissa Fortes.

The track became number one on Dance-Tunes and also got nominated as 'best house' track at the Cabo Verde Music Awards 2012.

In 2013 you can expect several releases from Wesley Monteiro, which varies between Afro/ Latin House/ Tribal/ Techno & banging festival beats.

The release fits perfectly to the festival atmosphere and these tunes will keep you partying until the sun goes down.

Nowadays his music is combination of various elements brilliantly blended together. In his own words “the biggest importance to me in music is feel, or emotion, without it music has no purpose.” 

Lucky Number 7 is all about the repeated vocal and hypnotic keys simulating your favorite times of clubbing with your friends. Stewart is a master of atmospheric tracks who constructs his songs with subtle breakdowns and groovy build ups.  This track combines some lovely synth lines and provides its listener an overall feeling of happiness. Three unique remixes come from Philthy Phonics, OctavPaul and Absolewt Master.

In 1954, Aldous Huxley introduced the concept of „Mind at Large“ to help interpret psychedelic experiences. According to this concept, the human mind filters reality under normal circumstances while psychedelic drugs remove the filter, exposing the user to a Mind at Large. 

For our new release, label boss Noema selected 15 tracks to help you open these doors of perception. Furthermore, this compilation showcases the rich musical spectrum of The Magic Movement, from ethnic Downbeat and midtempo Indie Dance to uptempo House Music, always with a psychedelic touch and a lot of love for the detail.

The compilation is structured like a DJ set by Noema. It starts hypnotic and slow, then continuously increases the tempo until it reaches ecstatic upbeat domains:
 
Our journey begins with uplifting and funky Downbeat by KÖNI in an edit by Noema, El Remolon, Bliz Nochi, Geju and a dubby 80s disco bonanza by The Oddness.

After a side trip to South America and Spain, featuring future-RnB rhythms by Landikhan with Dat Garcia and the driving electronic cumbia dancefloor bomb by Nat Barrera in a Noema edit, we catch our breath during some more minimal and hypnotic tracks by Y.Loh, Acid Pauli and Kermesse in a Xique-Xique remix.

Now in the mid-tempo range, we explore a playful and süper groovy jam by Sabda, as well as a shiny track by Kermesse and the marching drums of Noema & Dandara. 

In the last section, we go upbeat with Future-Jazz-House by Wilde See until we take off to the grand finale, a superb House Music sunset anthem by Serpoosh & Noema. 

And as Huxley points out, “The man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out. He will be wiser but less sure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his ignorance yet better equipped to understand the relationship of words to things, of systematic reasoning to the unfathomable mystery which it tries, forever vainly, to comprehend”

After the success of their debut album in 2018, Kermesse again teams up for some finishing touches with Noema as a co-producer and delivers a stunning new EP for The Magic Movement.

First up we have the title track, ‘Astro Travellin’, a shimmering midtempo groove that will ignite the dancefloor despite its slow pace, steadily building and dropping in all the right places Next up we slightly up the tempo and bring you the deep sublime grooves of ‘Going Down’, a hypnotic vocal refrain nuzzles up alongside a solid groove and warm guitar licks for a proper summer track, will sound great on the terraces, in the fields and on the beaches over the coming months. We follow this with Paracosm, again upping the tempo and cut from a slightly more electronic cloth, more of a bumping house groove but still retaining the same warmth and depth of sound Finally we have Raindance, retaining the same deep and bumping house not house sound, an upping the tempo slightly again to reach the climax of a quality EP	1679039	all		28548	playlist		2015-10-13T13:39:45Z	all-rights-reserved	1	False	andy-ash-astro-travellin-ep-uv016	https://soundcloud.com/universalvibes/sets/andy-ash-astro-travellin-ep-uv016	True		http://universalvibes.ithinkmusic.com/my-store/detail.php?page=LR&r=8952	2009-08-05T00:00:00Z	0		public		Andy Ash-Astro Travellin' EP-UV016	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/28548	1212		False		2009-08-04T23:49:14Z	4	450707,450746,450772,450791

          Here I Am was on the first vinyl sampler and received some amazing feedback, warm chords, heavy production and chopped up vocals combine in a heady groove that will flood the dancefloor with warm soulful waves.
          This is followed by Rootz, a slightly old school groove brought right up to date, again oozing warmth from its electronic heart …proper deep house music
          Finally we have Shecago, again  old school in its sound but thoroughly modern in its groove and production, with a slightly mellower feel than the other tracks.
          Three tracks of deep, electronic soulful house music from an artist we predict big things for…will appeal to fans of labels like Freerange, Buzzin’ Fy and Urban Torque…

    First up we feature a new face to Universal Vibes, Liverpool based beatsmith Andy Ash delivers a midtempo 4/4 deep track, Astro Travellin’. Shimmering 4 to the floor beats rub alongside sublime warm keys with a hint of disco and house. Following have a slice of bumping grinding beats in the shape of the Soulsonix remix of OK_Ma’s dancefoor destroying jump up house bomb, Boogle. Paddy Freeform takes a simple loop from the original and adds an energetic synth line alongside to push the track along. Finally we re-visit one of the early releases and press Jafar and Bobby Strobe’s ‘Keeps Coming’ to vinyl.. , an incessant vocal chant urges on the groove which builds throughout the track til the 303 bass lifts it up and twists it into oblivion.
    
    This is the final vinyl sampler for the compilation itself , which is mixed by Paddy Freeform (Soulsonix) and drops at the end of April…featuring a selection of the labels back catalogue highlights alongside some previews of forthcoming material

MADE WITH LOVE BY DAIRMOUNT & NOWAKOWSKI 
A&R BY DAIRMOUNT

After an acclaimed serie of remixes on labels like Freerange, Fresh Meat, Composite & Komplex De Deep in 2011, Dairmount is back on his own imprint with Dust Devil. Recorded this summer between Gothenburg & Berlin with Nowakowski, the Swedish hotshot of the label, Dust Devil emphasized strongly Dairmount’s love for House music infused of Hip Hop attitude. The motto is clear : reduced number of elements, samples only, maximum impact. Dairmount, who has always been strongly influenced by Hip Hop production techniques, had lots of fun to collaborate with Nowakowski, another strong Hip Hop influenced tweaker.
Following a busy dj schedule that brought him in the last 18 months across Scandinavia, US, Turkey, France, Holland & Latvia between others, Dairmount is the true soul & ambassador of the label that he created in 2009.

Collecting records since his childhood, he slowly discovered the world of spinning with his early Hip Hop heroes such as Dj Premier & Pete Rock, early records of Acid house and the versatility of Gilles Peterson’s Talkin Loud imprint. As a result of this, he immersed himself in the deepness of the Black music history : Jazz, Latin , Hip Hop, Detroit Techno, House and Afro Funk entered his record collection.

In the nineties, he quickly built himself a solid reputation in the underground club circuit that granted him to play at several major events in Benelux including the famous Eskimo nights (before it became a famous label) or big festivals as Dour, 10 Days Off or Axion Beach and extended his dj trips across Europe & overseas alongside prestigious spinners such as Kevin Saunderson, Gilles Peterson, Jazzanova, Rainer Trüby, Derrick May, Mad Mats, Dimitri from Paris, Fred Everything, King Britt, Kirk Di Giorgio, Jimpster or 4hero and opened concerts for performers like Herbie Hancock and St Germain. He also proudly represented Belgium at the 2nd edition of the now world reknown Red Bull Music Academy held in 99 in Berlin.

Dairmount contributed during 8 years as one of the main editors of the respected Plastiks magazine in Belgium before founding in 2003 metronomic-family.com, a web portal as a means to share his musical beliefs with a worldwide audience. Overwhelmed by positive feedback of hungry music lovers worldwide, the site managed to create a prolific discovery factor that contributed many upcoming artists & underground labels to reach a wider audience.
Known by many as a “man of challenge & initiative”, he moved from his native Brussels in 1999 to explore other countries leading him to live a transatlantic passion for Montreal (where he managed & restyled the legendary Primitive record shop) and landed in Hamburg in 2003. Actively taking part to future developments of the ever-changing music industry, Phil took part to the digital revolution in its early steps and became in 2004 (till present) A&R and label manager of respected labels such as Trusme’s Prime Numbers, Gerd’s 4Lux Black, Soulphiction’s Philpot, Jazzanova’s Sonar Kollektiv, Jimpster’s Freerange, Theo Parrish’s Sound Signature and many others inside the team of the respected digital indie Finetunes.

Besides his dedication & work for others, Phil stepped in the studio in 2005 to give birth to his early production projects such as Smiles Ahead (with David Alexander) & Petter & Dairmount (with Ralf Petter) which resulted in remix works for artists as diverse as “ex-Beanfield” Sandboy, swedish prodigies Hird & Yukimi Nagano (from Little Dragon fame) & NYC’s producer Moses McClean on labels like Hinterland (Ger), DNM (Swe) and Still Music (US). With great encouragements and plays from luminaries as Jimpster, Atjazz, Laurent Garnier, Mr Scruff, Sasse or Jazzanova, he caught the virus trying more and more to escape his busy schedule to push his production skills. This led Phil to become Dairmount, his new identity & production moniker and to create his own production unit with his long time friend Marino Berardi (known as Dairmount & Berardi, today on hold) & to the accomplishment of his long time dream, the launch of his own label, Room With A View, in April 2009.

The original of “My Bluff” appeared earlier this year on Audio Soul Project’s full length “Hip Shake Heartache”. This tune combines the voice of talented Minneapolis native Alexander East with a tempered electric piano performance by Frenchman Richard Gow. Mazi’s original production is part Salsoul-style disco, part 90s deep house. For this mighty remix package we’ve enlisted talents from Germany and our beloved home town Chicago.

Hot of their highly successful remixwork for Freerange and Composite, Phil Darimont and Marino Berardi aka Dairmount & Berardi present the first reinterpretation of “My Bluff”. Their organic approach is astutely modern, taking it’s time to develop; each element - the new electric piano, the freshly chopped Alexander vocals, the re-freaked guitar licks, the arpeggiated synthesizer - slowly blooms to the surface of the mix. The Hamburg natives manage to invent a remix that is at once atmospheric and bone crushing on the dance floor. The Dairmount & Berardi Perspective walks the path trodden by stalwarts like Tom Middleton, Circulation or Moodymann in one of his psychedelic moods.

Third wave Chicago phenomenon Joshua Iz takes the reins for his ‘Vizual Mix’. Josh has been a staple in the Chicago and San Francisco house scenes since the mid 90s releasing some of our favorite tracks via landmark labels like Prescription, Guidance, NRK and Tweekin. He just released his impeccable “It Iz What It Iz” long player on Vizual Records. His 10 minute plus reworking of “My Bluff” uses all of Alexander’s vocals rewriting the musical structure from the ground up. The result is a cosmic disco romp brimming with layers of pads, emotional strings, subtle drones, finely sculpted synth stacks and bouncing staccato bass - the sound is almost new wave and completely Iz.

Klas Lindblad’s Freestyle Man pseudonym should need no introduction among house heads. Under one of his many guises (either as Sasse, Thirsty Monk, Mr. Negative, Morris Brown or others) Klas has steadily become one of Germany’s most revered and consistent house producers. His spacious Easy Street Dub of “My Bluff” is designed for the long blend. Each of the loosely swinging elements hop almost invisibly into the sequence, imprinting an unforgettable groove into any dancers long term memory. The swelling strings, skipping echoed clavinet and morphing sub bass serve as perfect compliments to edited parts from the original.

The final entry in this package is an elegant extended version of “My Bluff”. The track’s main sections are kept intact with additional bars of rhythm added to the introduction and end maximizing every last bit of groove for club play. 

Feedback highlights so far:

Just like the label itself, this release goes many places. A-sides' Zurückbleiben is an electro influenced, up-tempo techno track with deep, subby bassline and atonal synth-chords. B-side is where you find the house sound that Göran is known for. B1 is a held back, groovy remake of a love-longing female vocal, deep and dubby. B2 takes it a few BPMs up, a quirky bassline, lots of drums and a spooky, trippy pad. Yeah!

Dj's say:

Sweet and tasty bangers! will be dropping 'zuruckbleiben' in my house sets! 

- Ed Davenport

Quality like always. Not a single disappointment with The Free Spirit Society and especially not when Mr Labelboss gets to do the material. Tune in vie Backend is my personal favourite, I can see myself playing this a lot. 5/5!

- Johanna Knutsson

Another excellent Sank Goran EP, crossing house, techno, and everything in between in his signature style.  This one will be in my bag all summer

– Ryan Elliott

When some of the originators of house music have taken a one way flight to play at the disco in the sky it is nice to heat that their legacy is taken care of whit such delicacy as Sankt Görans'.

- Axel Boman

Holy Sankt Göran! Nice little 3 Tracker. Is it House meets Techno or Techno meets House? Time To Tjeck! Sweet

- Roger 23

Consisting of Peter's unreleased tracks, rediscovered sketches and material from his live shows, Uncovered offers a coherent overview of his creative process during this period, deconstructing his inimitable aesthetic across three distinct volumes.

With the launch of Time To Express in 2008, Peter created a platform to explore the niche he had become increasingly drawn to - a sound that brings us from sweltering warehouse raves to the misty mountains of Japan, tracing the universal effects of psychedelic sound design and swirling, hypnotic techno throughout a global underground.

Whilst listening back to his old material, it became clear to Peter that this ten-year period formed its own chapter in his discography. Of the three volumes, each one chronicles a different aspect of his sound and can generally be separated into Vol. 1 consisting of ambient works, Vol. 2 of slower bpms and Vol.3 offering faster techno and breakbeats.

Consisting of Peter's unreleased tracks, rediscovered sketches and material from his live shows, Uncovered offers a coherent overview of his creative process during this period, deconstructing his inimitable aesthetic across three distinct volumes.

With the launch of Time To Express in 2008, Peter created a platform to explore the niche he had become increasingly drawn to - a sound that brings us from sweltering warehouse raves to the misty mountains of Japan, tracing the universal effects of psychedelic sound design and swirling, hypnotic techno throughout a global underground.

Whilst listening back to his old material, it became clear to Peter that this ten-year period formed its own chapter in his discography. Of the three volumes, each one chronicles a different aspect of his sound and can generally be separated into Vol. 1 consisting of ambient works, Vol. 2 of slower bpms and Vol.3 offering faster techno and breakbeats.

My approach to compose music is more of kinda playful and has to do with rhythms and chord changes. Finding elements that fit together or make contrast, creating parts in atmosphere, mood and arrangement, keeping balance in these elements and bringing all material together in the mix or on the sheet.

‘Atlas:Remixed’
(Slime Recordings)
Cat # SLM090

Slime Recordings reached a new milestone this year with the launch of its first physical release – the debut album from Swedish producer Materia. ‘Atlas’ was the result - an album that extrapolates the fundamentals of house, garage, dubstep and techno - then fuses them into a listening experience full of warmth and texture which reveals further depths through every repeated play. The album garnered a lot of accolades, with Igloo Magazine calling it “a genuine work of substance” and Electronic Music Magazine describing it as “immensely satisfying”.

To celebrate the success of the release, Slime has commissioned six producers to remix some of the key tracks on the album. The result is an intriguing selection from some of the most creative underground producers working today.

First up we welcome Submerse back to the label. One of the most talented producers around, here he develops on the sound he has been cultivating on his Project:Mooncircle releases with a slow motion version of the lead track from the album, ‘Otherland’. Extrapolating all the original elements of the track and twisting them into something completely new and refreshing, it’s clear to see why he is so highly regarded as an artist.

‘Otherland’ is taken into another direction by the legendary drum & bass producer Macc, who we have managed to coax out of retirement to tackle this remix. The original’s ethereal qualities are kept intact, but infused with truly astounding drum work and delicate melodies reconstructed with pin-sharp clarity for a mix that is truly special.

For the final remix of the lead track, Dublin-based producer Genetix twists the original into a shuffling deep dubstep roller replete with sparkling synths and cavernous low-end that will rattle chests and elevate minds.

Next up, Bristol-based producer Lojik takes on ‘Clouds’. One of the stand-out tracks from the original release, it’s staccato downbeat rhythm is finessed into a bass-heavy groove with superb bars from Bristol MC Koast driving the beat forward alongside the sublime vocals of New York vocalist Winter.

Swedish producer Petter B takes on the closing track from the album, ‘Synthesis’. The Drumcode artist manipulates the spaced-out style of the original into a rolling techno stomper where sparkling melodies are strapped to a heavy-duty groove with devastating results.

Completing the set Bristol-based producer Discord takes ‘Synthesis’ into altogether darker territory with a throbbing techno jam complete with acidic licks and snapping percussion that continually builds until the dancefloor will be in a frenzy.

Here though we see him deliver his latest three-track EP via Outlaw, leading the release is ‘Viislampi Dub’ which sees the Finish artist employ classic dub tropes such a fluttering stab sequences and a choppy sub hits alongside a subtly nuanced drum groove.
‘Viimsi’ follows next to open the flip-side, this time round laying focus on hazy pads, bumpy off-kilter percussion and jazzy synth melodies before ‘Nocturnal Dub’ rounds out the release on a stripped-back tip. Employing an amalgamation of sharp synth flutters which ebb and flow around one another amongst a minimalistic, swinging rhythm and expansive echoes."	362136	all	Techno	1117664236	playlist		2020-08-26T14:32:12Z	cc-by	27	False	tm-shuffle-waterside-dubs-ep	https://soundcloud.com/matthewoh/sets/tm-shuffle-waterside-dubs-ep	True			2020-10-09T00:00:00Z	4		public	"Techno dub minimal Deep dubtechno Outlaw ""Matthewo Oh"" ""Tm Shuffle"""	TM Shuffle - Waterside Dubs EP [Outlaw008]	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1117664236	1310	single	True	2020-08-26T14:27:36Z	2020-08-26T14:27:36Z	3	882374818,882374782,882374752

Ohm & Octal Industries have been steadily making their mark on the deep and dub
leaning Techno world over the past five years, racking up releases on the likes of
Rawax, Andrey Pushkarev’s Luck Of Access, Nilla and of Thule Records amongst
others. Here though we see the pair joining the roster of Outlaw, the Italian imprint run

by producer, DJ and Matthew Oh.

Kicking off the release is ‘Breather’, an apt name for the composition which attains an
underlying sense of calm via fluttering dub echoes, ethereal atmospherics and
wandering low-end tones while dynamic drums add the dance floor drive.
‘Strange Attractions’ follows next, edging into darker realms via murky synth textures,
squelching 303 licks and thunderous subs before ‘Creation’ rounds out the release,
stripping things back to bumpy shuffled drums, sweeping stab sequences and dubbed

(hormonal perturbator in decay), Mad Jakale, Frau Strapatz, Crucial Pink, and guests. For such a variete show, that contained dance, singing, acting and improvisation in parts, with a comical and criticial bend number of electronic musical fragments and reworked reappropriated recordings were written and produced. While the series continues in 2014 and onwards with new noise eruptions and electronic remixes Nova deViator gathered sound fragments for this EP and additionally upgraded and reworked them.

i quickly discovered.. just how capable this little synth really is .. by thinking outside of the synced music box.. 

Enjoy! 

All sounds generated by Bleeplabs Nebulophone, and played by hand. Multitrack recorded in Ableton Live.

In the last three years the album was spread over the internet and reached about 30.000 listeners all over the world where it found general approval. The production of the JOEY BURNS EP and the forthcoming album took place with the support of Music Producer Hannes Jackl from AMPERSAND and features musicians and singers from the bands SCHMACKES UND PINSCHER, MOUTH, LUNATIC SKYDANCE and THE LO-FI FAIR.

The release of the new album THE JUDAS HOLE (including 10 brand-new tracks) will follow later in 2011.

------------------
Q-Burns Abstract Message is an expert time traveler. But it’s not about the physical transportation of bodies into the past or future. Instead, these are sonic waves, vibrating in all directions, touching different eras and territories. Like a Stalker entering ‘The Zone,’ Q-BAM is forever in search of the undefinable. He’ll know it when he sees it, and today it’s looking like an AUDIOTOTEMPOLE.

M. Donaldson is Q-Burns Abstract Message, formerly broadcasting with Astralwerks and a handful of other co-conspirators. Over the decades he’s wielded turntables in locales from Novosibirsk to Antofagasta, but now he’s mostly quiet. Occasionally Q-Burns Abstract Message pops up in someone’s mix set, or mentioned in a blog post, or perhaps in an odd remix. But, for the most part, he’s a known unknown.

Now he’s reappeared, clutching an AUDIOTOTEMPOLE. It’s an homage to a secret history without the stain of nostalgia. These are songs spanning the lost years, buzzing with electricity and ritual ambiguity. “Tremble,” for example, is handed down from clouds, signaling Q-BAM’s transition from mystic to mystical. “Kept in a Shadehouse” undulates in continuous motion, brightly placing tones in orbit around its bristling center. And “Touchtones (1997)” is an earthy clue, creating the temporal connection — past meets present, full circle.

After two decades of an unbreakable friendship, we have finaly imaginated this protean entity to express what contemplation has offered us and how it connects us to the world, describing those experiences through music compositions, dj performances and welcoming other artists to release their art.

After our strong FRANCK ROGER release TIGER IN THE HOOD, we are really happy to get one of our two label drivers, ARNO E. MATHIEU, back on Solarism. «The Earth Project » is dedicated to planet earth and Arno’s feeling for nature, back in his childhood landscapes.

A1 – TEARS OF THE WHALES is an epic, melodic and hypnotic trip, drived by a strong drum and bass-line groove. 
Directly inspired by the Whales journey, this tune evoke also how much this majestic animal have always been an example of a pacific force. Evolving in the deepness of the oceans and traveling all over the planet, whales are also a symbol of how nature suffers of the impact and polution of consumerism system.

B1 – TERRA describs a melancolic and balearic long overview of Arno E. Mathieu’s chilhood landscape with percussive grooves, strong melodic bass-line and anthemic synth gimics. This new Arno’s track evolves in a tight structured arrangement evoking hills, lands and fields that inspired him for so long…

After our first release with Arno E. Mathieu ""Existance Project""included Juju & Jordash Rmx, we are really proud to welcome one of our musical friend on Solarism, the non-stop track maker from Home Invasion label, Franck Roger !

On A1 Franck brings a real fusion of Cosmics and classic Deep House vibes, remembering his first love with electronic music but definitely oriented to his nowaday modern vision of sounds. 
The melodic groove of the calimbas percussions drives you till the heart of the track and his swinging drum, to never let you go and brings you up in a neverending hypnotic mind dance. 

On B1, Arno E. Mathieu version push the hypnotic vibe of ""Tiger in The Hood"" using the original arpegiator theme, and brings the track to a deep techno level for a textured and anthemic experience. Ponctuated by a strings hit appearence and supported by a non stop heavy bass-line, the track progression brings us till a melodic synth conclusion true to Arno fusionned style...

A woman conceived as a contemporary Danae, dreaming of the golden rain and the elements of life.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMTh3s0ElYU

Originally composed for the movie format, the film version comes here with two others versions by the composer ARNO E. MATHIEU, and a remix by the talented producer from Ukraine, VAKULA. 

True to the Balearic vibe of the film version, the Arno E. Mathieu « Mi Version » lifts the original mix to a long emotional journey,  driven by a strong rhythmic part and a hypnotic bass-line. The track grows until it reaches an epic breakdown and then returns to the cinematic roots of this composition before coming to a powerful ending.

Vakula’s remix is more like a dubby analog interpretation with some old synth and congas jams, adding new textures and bringing a more deep-house feeling to the project. Led by the personality of the man from Ukraine, this remix drives us slowly but surely to a real different vibe from the original track"	618163	all	Clima 	109254692	playlist		2015-11-11T16:51:43Z	all-rights-reserved	5	False	arno-e-mathieu-despetrar	https://soundcloud.com/clima-solarism/sets/arno-e-mathieu-despetrar	True				1		public		Arno E Mathieu - Despetrar	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/109254692	1764		False		2015-05-19T23:00:17Z	3	206281678,206281673,206281671

When I finally discovered it, I immediately liked the feeling of the Singer and the guitar parts in the song. It was the perfect opportunity to make our conversation a reality. Raoul sent me the voice & guitar separated parts, then I started to do new music like drums, bass-lines and synthesizers and re-edit the whole song to make it works with my vision of the track.

Synthek & Audiolouis, Centrific and Marco FIMP are all welcomed into the EDEC family while inviting back heavyweights M-A-E 

Synthek & Audiolouis start things off with Lost In The Maze. Deep Techno beats laced with soft keys and a rampage of percussion.

Stronghold M-A-E come back with 333 their signature full on sound of Techno. Hard fx´s and vicious drums combine in a number for the true heads. 

Centrific steps up to bat on U Pod. The finest in acid-house slowing building to destroy any rationing or reasoning, just dance. 

Marco FIMP with Audiophorm OSV come to play with a raw tribal groove and spooky organs creaping in.

This young Argentine has been on the cusp and breath of techno heavyweights the past year. EDEC007 is no different with a stricter form to the words Underground Techno.

From one new talent to another as we also welcome Boston´s young techno heroes B-Tracks. 
Known for killer sets at Panorama Bar and their releases on Supply Records, the duo decide to revamp things up twice. Double the pleasure double the fun.

This time around, EDEC invites a few new names to the table, Lilith and Latecomer Productions, while bringing back some familiar members of the EDEC family,  like Vid and M-A-E. 

From the tough darkness of Lilith “Mercurius Retrograde,” to the rolling groove of Vid’s “Terminal,” the powerful hypnotism of M-A-E 3344, and the deep pulse of Latecomer Prod. “Lefter’, our mission stays the same: deliver original underground house and techno without compromise.

sparring partner, Lomez. Over the course of the
last three years the duo have released a string
of singles with Minisketch, Surface Recordings
and Isgud and are currently enjoying great
support for their new ""Has To Be Love"" ep on
My Favorite Robot.

The duo's sound definitely has its roots in the
US.  The wonderfully deep ""3rd Wave"" definitely nods to
the Stateside influence with its classic touches,
smooth synth chords and spoken vocal drops.

Who better to remix the original than New
Jersey's DJ Qu, who with his signature cut ups
and splices delivers a rework to complete a
perfect club package, or as the label puts it, ""a
great balance of a party starter and a cut that
drives the party to peak time.""

""Dutch DJ and producer Olivier Boogie has been doing his thing in Amsterdam, largely without credit, for the best part of a decade. He's previously released both original productions and re-edits, with two contributions to a split Lumberjacks In Hell release back in 2012 standing out. Here he returns - at long last - with an edit EP of his own for Whiskey Disco. There's naturally much to admire, from the soaring strings, undulating bass and disco-funk hustle of ""Got To Have Loving"" and jaunty Rodriguez re-rub ""Can't Get Away"" being particularly potent. He also delivers a dash of head-nodding boogie (""You Know Who""), and turns a little-known funk jam into a shuffling house hustler (""Lost In The Crowd"").""

There are only 4 tracks left, compiled from different record takes. «Mandarins» is the only original here; the following «I Gather Sounds» is an excerpt from another live session. Stripped-down version of «Things Change» goes next, and the final number is «Freight» - previously unreleased ambient composition. 

Morning walk, hazy waters, wet soles; later — thick forest and urban jungle, and above all that — eternal inconstancy of heaven.

music (and beyond that), love is not something that HipHop
artists talk about very frequently. There are many more rap songs
about recreational drug use, material wealth, not-quite-legal activities
or casual sex than there are about that other four letter word, L.O.V.E.

In comes „The Luv Bug“, a concept album entirely devoted to the big
topic: From the sparks of initially meeting an attractive woman (Familiar
Stranger) to planning the rest of your life together (Future Love),
from make-ups (Keep On Loving) to break-ups (Summer‘s Gone) and
from fantasizing about an ethereal beauty (Out Of Orbit) to deception
(Adesina), Chicago MCs Just Jay & Wisdm O.N.E. a.k.a. 1773 touch
on a wide variety of subjects.

The musical foundation is provided by the other end of this transatlantic
musical endeavour, producer Trishes from Vienna/Austria. He
manages to create quite different vibes - from spacey futuristic Beats
to almost classic Boom Bap sound and even farther back to 80s
drum computer patterns – while maintaining enough of a common
thread and feeling to keep the music cohesive. All together, this is a
pretty infectious record. Or, to quote from the intro: ""The Luv Bug will
bite you if you don‘t watch out… Watch Out!“"	1498446	all	Love Rapp	1369472	playlist	Duzz Down San	2015-10-13T13:59:20Z	all-rights-reserved	20	False	the-luv-bug	https://soundcloud.com/trishes/sets/the-luv-bug	True		http://1773xtrishes.bandcamp.com/album/the-luv-bug-deluxe-version	2012-01-23T00:00:00Z	4		public	hiphop rap soul future boombap chicago chicagohiphop vienna	1773 x Trishes - The Luv Bug	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1369472	1856	album	True		2011-12-05T23:13:52Z	11	29835166,29835167,29835168,29835170,29835171,29835172,29835174,29835176,29835178,29835181,29835183

Certainly, the music of Dnepr is gloomy, dim and in parts ominous. But it does not exhaust itself in
oppressive mud and bombastic lunacy. From the menacing swamp, sound figures rise from time to
time and find a moment of ethereal beauty, as if two monsters kiss each other before disappearing
again into murky ground fog and atonal madness.

WERNER HASLER | THE OUTER STRING - OUT TOO
OUT TOO is an installation, is a concert, is an exhibition

OUT TOO | the outer string | optickle | stettlerbros. 67

OUT TOO takes a look at a wildly romantic landscape of rocky edifices, forests and streams in the region of Krauchthal, through the lens of a semi-automatic eye. Origami-like images unfold to fill the space embedded in a sculptured sound-world, revealing a special piece of nature.

Sounds recorded on-site weave with the warm tones of actual and synthesised trumpets and celli.

OUT TOO takes the common contemporary idea of ‘experience before experience’ to a new level in a virtual-design reality and transforms a real piece of the world into a hyper-real event.*

Moonstarr teams up with Montreal's Kelly Nunes on ‘Starlight’, a raw house cut with deep techno soul roots.  ‘Starlight’ evokes the fragmented memories of a past romance that flood the mind while driving through the city in the dead of night, steam rising from sewer grates. Drawing on inspiration from Abacus, Mark Flash, Recloose and Shawn Rudiman, the original keeps building with anticipation, while the energetic remix pays homage to early 90s club days in Toronto. 
 
Over the last two years, Moonstarr has released exclusive tracks on underground labels such as Pittsburgh’s Love What You Feel and Berlin’s Parages Music. A 12 inch EP is in the works for Adam Marshall’s New Kanada imprint, as well as the follow-up to Ill Harmonics Vol. 1 on PTR Music. ‘C-Minus Particles’ is still getting love four years on from the likes of George Fitzgerald, Art Department (BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix), Maceo Plex (featured his on Mixmag Dec. 2013 mix), and was recently licensed to a forthcoming Rainer Truby compilation on Compost Records.
 
Moonstarr continues to push innovative sounds on the long-running bi-weekly Future Classic Radio show on CKUT 90.3 FM in Montreal with co-host The One Tash. The show is available for stream on www.futureclassic.ca.
 
Fifteen years strong, Public Transit Recordings continues its mission to release cutting-edge Hip Hop, Future Soul and Electronic Music from Canadian and international artists. www.ptrmusic.com

‘Mystery of Ages’ a lost classic composed by saxophone player and spiritual jazz funk legend Carlos Garnett in 1976. Reinterpreted by Japan’s dancefloor jazz purists Kyoto Jazz Massive. Remixed and reconfigured by Moonstarr.Now released on Public Transit Recordings, with proceeds going to Living Dreams, an organization supporting Japanese youth affected by the March 2011 earthquake.
‘Mystery of Ages’ was a personal challenge for Carlos back in 1976. A self-taught saxophonist, he pushed his boundaries in arrangement and scoring for a big band. That musical exploration became a journey posing big questions with a big sound, and captured the spirit of New York’s avant garde jazz funk community at that time. The song is a beautiful acknowledgement of our true naïveté about the universe, with Cheryl Alexander’s voice invoking questions about the meaning of human existence.
Inspired by the original, Kyoto Jazz Massive (KJM) covered the song with a fresh take on ideas and arrangements, featuring Shota Hishiyama on Rhodes, Kenichi Ikeda (Root Soul) on bass, and the incredible Bembe Segue on vocals (who does justice to Cheryl’s original takes).Somewhere along the way, Moonstarr was given a sneak preview into KJM’s creative process via a bootleg of an acapella version of sorts.Persuaded by friend and fellow producer Yosaku, Moonstarr remixed the cover with his signature staccato breaks and chopped loop arrangements.
With blessings from KJM and Carlos Garnett, PTR will release ‘Mystery of Ages – Moonstarr Remixes” on a limited 7inch in advance of KJM’s 2012 album release.
Proceeds of the project will be going to Tohoku Kids Project (Living Dreams in collaboration with Smile Kids Japan), upholding Carlos Garnett’s ethos of passing on positive knowledge to younger generations. Living Dreams gives kids hope though alternative support such as supplying musical instruments to orphanages in the affected regions of Japan’s devastating earthquake of 2011.
The only thing missing is Carlos’ sax. Stay tuned...

The Archive - Unreleased and notable selections from the past.

Digging through dusty boxes of old cassette tapes, floppies and DATs, Moonstarr decided to compile some unreleased and classic joints from The Archive.This nostalgic look back reveals signature vinyl-only dancefloor jams praised by DJs and tastemakers the world over, as well as unreleased joints that are just now escaping Moonstarr's studio walls.

Previous vinyl-only joints include: 
Detriot:A deep house anthem originally released on Jazzanova’s Sonar Kollectiv in 2004. Misspelling intentional to con- nect back to tumultuous times of civil unrest in the city that birthed Techno. 
Greed Remix: Sweat-soaked samba dancefloor stormer originally released on Compost Records in 2003. 
Don't Sweat It: Batucada Tech sounds originally featured on Portugal’s Grooovement Records in 2005. 
The Recipe: A moody electro number originally released on Toronto’s Chair Records headed by Dan Lui in early 00's. 
Scarborough RT: Moonstarr’s contribution to the very first 12” released by PTR called Metropass showcasing the man’s musical obsessions, melting Hip Hop and Bossa Nova.

Unreleased joints hitting eardrums worldwide for the first time: 
Take It Back: Deep Techno rooted in the turn of the century and thick withY2K dreaming. 
Running: A moody tribute to the broken techno sounds of late 1990s in proto-broken beat era. 
Nasdaq: Quirky d’n’b tune created in response to the infamous dot com stock market crash in the late 1990s. 
Marz: As the rover landed on Mars countless space dreamers followed its adventures by eagerly examining all photos beamed back to Earth. 3-D glasses were adorned to examine this foreign landscape. Hence, a soundtrack was born."	3959517	all	Electronic	459553	playlist	Public Transit Recordings	2015-10-13T13:46:54Z	all-rights-reserved	16	False	the-archive-1	https://soundcloud.com/moonstarr/sets/the-archive-1	True		http://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-archive/id408937621?uo=4	2010-12-14T00:00:00Z	1		public	"""Broken Techno"" ""Unreleased Joints"""	The Archive (Moonstarr Retrospective)	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/459553	1906	album	True		2010-12-06T05:30:01Z	9	7740203,7740204,7740205,7740206,7740207,7740209,7740208,7740210,7775752

On this latest release, Moonstarr embarked on a series of late-night studio missions to explore the deep, moody regions of sound. Chopped breaks and dirty jazz loops are eschewed for synthesizers and drum machines to program the exploration into dark emotion and dissonance. Built upon the foundation created by steadfast pioneers like Mike Banks, Larry Heard, Shawn Rudiman, Purpose Maker and Drexcyia, and inspired by a conversation between Abacus and Marc Mac years earlier in which they discussed the need for vocals to permeate more techno music. Moonstarr continues the tradition and searches for the elusive 'C-Minus Particles' that disperse as quickly as they are created. On 'Monopoly', guest vocalist Tash sounds out a determined call for working-class justice overtop soaring synth lines, warm bass pulses and insistent rhythms. ILL Harmonics is part one in a series that will continue to travel the soundways in a complementary style to this release.

Feedback:

Shuya Okino (Kyoto Jazz Massive) “Monopoly is amazing... strong electronic soul music!”
Daedelus “The music is wonderful. I think it's the bee's knees!”
Marc Mac (4-Hero) “Dope”
Chris Vogado (ZeroDB)    “Awe inspiring”
Jwan Allen (Technoir Audio) “Devastating combo of NJ house vocal stylings with Canadian/Detroit tech-funk electronics”

Chunky roughed up house beats are the order of the day here, a real peak time groove. New talent 'Harry McCanna', resident at London's infamous 'Undersound' nights, debuts with 'Act 1', a beautifully subtle bassline driven groove that rises above the pack with it's super warm pad lending the track a warm and fuzzy hypnotic edge. Romanian talent 'Zece' kicks off the flipside with the most contemporary offering; a breakbeat laden groove with a fx laden vocal snatch underpinned by that all important b-line whilst 'Sonodab' rounds things off with a beautifully deep and melodic slice of electro on 'Brown Study', the percussive elements giving rise to a hazy melodic pattern for those early hour excursions.	366188	all	house	6965039	playlist	Fear of Flying	2015-10-13T14:34:28Z	all-rights-reserved	87	False	various-artists-volume-3	https://soundcloud.com/fear-of-flying-recordings/sets/various-artists-volume-3	True		http://www.decks.de/t/various_artists-various_artists_volume_3_ep/c1p-rf	2013-07-17T00:00:00Z	6		public	"Nail ""Fear of flying"" ""harry mccanna"" ""vinyl only"" sonodab zece romania house ""tech house"" ""deep house"""	Various Artists Volume 3	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/6965039	1916	ep	True		2013-06-21T10:50:37Z	4	97823840,97823841,97823842,97823843

Lastly, Roger teams up with his buddy Smokin' G on 'Drunk Game', super rounded, housed up beats and an undulating synth / string line permeate the groove lending the ep a sense of levity.	286063	all	Tech House	4561345	playlist	Fear of Flying Record Label	2015-10-13T14:29:24Z	all-rights-reserved	16	False	roger-gerressen-liberal	https://soundcloud.com/fear-of-flying-recordings/sets/roger-gerressen-liberal	True			2013-04-24T00:00:00Z	1		public	"""Roger Gerressen"" ""Fear of Flying"" ""Dub Techno"" House ""Deep House"""	Roger Gerressen - Liberal	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/4561345	1916	ep	True		2013-04-05T09:16:21Z	3	86480257,86480258,86480259

Originally released on the UK's revered DIY Discs imprint all the tracks on this ep have proven hard to get hold of over the preceding years with nary a copy available on Discogs for anything less than a King's Ransom. 

'Clear My Mind' was recently featured on Dyed Soundorom's DJ Mag covermount mix whilst 'Try' was included on Andrew Weatherall's early 'Essential' mixes and 'Til The Feelings Gone' was a standout on the recent Fabric compilation by Zip. With a pedigree like that its an easy choice to make, especially with the bonus cut 'Optimus' which proves to be the tougher of the 4 tracks giving a nice rounded edge to the ep."	0	all	Deep House	3262583	playlist	Fear of Flying Recordings	2015-10-13T14:24:23Z	all-rights-reserved	96	False	nail-ode-rammel	https://soundcloud.com/fear-of-flying-recordings/sets/nail-ode-rammel	True		http://www.juno.co.uk/products/477866-01.htm/?ref=label_fearofflying	2013-01-28T00:00:00Z	4		public	"Nail ""Fear of Flying"" ""Tech House"""	Nail - Ode Rammel	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/3262583	1916	ep	True		2013-01-10T14:22:10Z	0

When the house was evacuated I moved my studio, moved on to other projects and never released the tracks. They were played live from an Atari 1040ST computer with just a drum machine, an Akai S1000 sampler and a couple of synths.

Cozzy D has been at the helm of the Lower East imprint over the past six years A&Ring the imprint and welcoming the likes of Gerd, Larry Heard, MK, Kris Wadsworth and Alexis Raphael into its back catalogue. Amongst this Cozzy has branched out with his own material for reputable imprint such as ViVa Music, Material, Get Physical and of course his beloved home of Lower East.
Here though we see him return to the latter with two fresh cuts, the first of which ‘At The Rave’ takes the reins as the title-track and as the name would suggest embraces a nostalgic rave influence via bumpy breaks, heavy doses of sub bass, subtly blooming stab sequences and ethereal pad swells resulting in a contemporary twist on a classic format.
Closing is ‘Rub & Chugg’ which again is fittingly named and employs a slow-burning chuggy bass hook, and crunchy percussion alongside vacillating synth whirrs and hypnotic vocal licks.

Cozzy D’s ‘At The Rave’ is out on Lower East 29th July 2016.

Here though we see him return to the latter with two fresh cuts, the first of which ‘At The Rave’ takes the reins as the title-track and as the name would suggest embraces a nostalgic rave influence via bumpy breaks, heavy doses of sub bass, subtly blooming stab sequences and ethereal pad swells resulting in a contemporary twist on a classic format.
Closing is ‘Rub & Chugg’ which again is fittingly named and employs a slow-burning chuggy bass hook, and crunchy percussion alongside vacillating synth whirrs and hypnotic vocal licks.

Cozzy D’s ‘At The Rave’ is out on Lower East 29th July 2016.

However, if our 14yr anniversary party was our final jam, we couldn’t have ended our run in better fashion. We were on the Luke Fair and Brad Copeland tip from the very beginning and it would only be fitting if they were the ones who saw us out in the end.

Luke Fair’s set was a master class in groove, but we scored his INTIMATE & ON THE BOAT Summer Reunion set to share, so we thought it best we leave his anniversary set for those who were on the dance floor.  However, it’s been way too long since we hosted a live Brad Copeland mix in our archive, so that’s the memory we have to share here.

Part 1 is some of the most beautiful deep and ambient house we’ve heard, maybe ever at a bringthebeats event.  And when Brad really starts to warm the room in Part 2, we can virtually place ourselves back in front of the booth, lost in ecstasy.  After all these years, Brad hasn’t lost an iota of his mixing precision and his ear for gems is quite simply something he’s been blessed with. If this is the last live bringthebeats recording we ever share, Brad Copeland's given us the perfect mix to go out on.

Thanks to everyone who supported our Summer Reunion once again this year. Your dedication is what keeps us grooving. That and these incredible tunes, of course.

After three test runs in the venue, we launched the series on our sixth anniversary in October 2008.

We joined forces with the Rogers Wireless Box Office to help beta test their new mobile ticketing technology and in the process provided the first five INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND‘s for FREE!! The first 11 I&U’s were bringthebeats solo missions, but from v12 to v27 they were co-promoted alongside the Groove Garden Recordings crew. Also born from the series and the Groove Garden partnership was INTIMATE & ON THE BOAT, which has featured three killer groove cruises. Both series were put to rest in August 2014.

In the summer of 2015 we retuned for an INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND reunion at TOiKA and an INTIMATE & ON THE BOAT reunion aboard the majestic Tall Ship Kajama. It’s not easy for us to stay away from the dance floor, either at TOiKA or on the Kajama, so expect more reunion jams in the unforeseeable future.

For now, here are adventures we’ve been able to capture for the world’s aural pleasure. We hope you love them as much as we continue to."	158379418	all	Electronic	184793167	playlist		2021-03-01T23:53:53Z	all-rights-reserved	5	False	intimate-and-underground	https://soundcloud.com/bringthebeats/sets/intimate-and-underground	True	INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND	http://www.bringthebeats.com/club-beats/intimate-and-underground		1		public	"House ""Deep House"" Tech Progressive Groovy Funky Melodic ""INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND"" ""INTIMATE & ON THE BOAT"" TOiKA Kajama Toronto Live ""Eelke Kleijn"" ""Miss Melera"" ""Neil Quigley"" ""Cesar Caballero"" ""Luke Fair"" Add2Basket DEMI ""Dustin Nantais"" ""Felipe Callado"""	INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/184793167	2138		False		2016-01-12T16:32:18Z	34	279877616,279877613,167872750,162750292,162750090,125648571,120114328,119950971,109887799,102006063,72199778,72198403,59390229,59428827,59426341,59422180,25247514,25785227,26363048,26883495,27539038,37393316,37393009,37394990,37394907,37394838,37394725,34307558,34307172,34306748,38242429,37465213,37464822,37464489

From Industry to System Soundbar, Element, Boa-Redux and all the coolest parties in between, if the music’s great, you know Craig’s somewhere in the room.  And when the music’s really great, there’s a good chance he’s controlling things in the booth.  

Craig’s first bringthebeats gig was in 2011 and he’s spun many incredible sets for us at TOiKA and on our cruises ever since.  Setting the stage for the likes of Luke Fair, Ian Pooley, Ricky Ryan, Jody Wisternoff and Omid 16B, Craig’s silky smooth and sexy style perfectly sets the bringthebeats vibe.  And his peak time sets at Parlour, inside the CTRL ROOM and even for Electric Circus back in the day, have had dance floors locked in a serious groove.  

bringthebeats wouldn’t have come nearly as far as we have it if weren’t for the support and tunes of Craig Anderson. As you’ll hear in this playlist, Craig puts all of his heart and soul into each promo mix and the results are timeless. He’s one of a kind in the club industry.  We’re so fortunate to have Craig Anderson in the bringthebeats crew.

EXPOSED was about bringing underground music back to the forefront.  We were out to create a house.music.re-evolution.

For our crew it had been since the early days of Breathe at System Soundbar. For the others it was in the beginning with Industry or at the incredible 270 Spadina space, Sonic / Boa-Redux. Regardless of wherever or whenever, for all of us, it had been way too long since a Toronto club night was truly dedicated to the underground, so we did something about it

EXPOSED hosted four distinct events each month…

bringthebeats championed the funky progressive house sound with former Stereo in Montreal, Atomic in Ottawa and System Soundbar resident Brad Copeland as the top jock for all bringthebeats bookings.  We also brought on Toronto favourite @djjeffbutton for one of his first residencies. 

Energie Entertainment enlisted DJs Addy & Neno for a week of serious party tunes. The cornerstone of EXPOSED, LIV Lifestyle Marketing supported the tribal and classic house sounds with @djaddy returning as resident for their nights.  And NocturnalMagazine.net & Till The AM featured an array of soulful vocal house to dirty tech and electro with @djandyreid and @simon-jain opening their nights. 

We took over Fridays at The Mod Club Theatre, home to the world famous Brit Pop Saturdays, as well as a rocking live-to-air on Thursdays. We hosted guest lists, promoted the parties and documented each night with reviews and pics on the EXPOSED website.  We’ve recreated some of the original posts in the mix descriptions and included the bringthebeats promo CDs, live sets and EXPOSED-inspired sets in the playlist below.  

For the better part of a year our Friday nights were EXPOSED.  We met some of our best friends and supporters on The Mod Club dance floor and the series paved the way for the INTIMATE & UNDERGROUND era that followed.  We’ll never forget our nights with @holosoundnyc, Luke Morrison, @rickyryan, @neil-quigley (twice), @naveen-g, @eliwilkie, @jodywisternoff and @terry-lee-brown-junior. And thanks to the ever-lasting memories in this music, we’ll never have to."	110444677	all	Electronic	115301549	playlist		2017-01-31T22:15:37Z	all-rights-reserved	5	False	exposed	https://soundcloud.com/bringthebeats/sets/exposed	True				3		public	"House Techno Progressive Electro ""Brad Copeland"" ""Eli Wilkie"" Holosound ""Luke Morrison"" ""Naveen G"" ""Neil Quigley"" ""Ricky Ryan"" ""Terry Lee Brown Jr."" EXPOSED Live ""Mod Club Theatre"" Toronto 2007 2008"	EXPOSED	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/115301549	2138		False		2015-06-09T20:59:37Z	18	209587927,209587926,153641437,153636549,209587942,209587944,209587933,209587930,209587935,126578487,126577844,126576530,209587937,209698305,209587940,209587938,209587948,209587941

TrAmHed ' U Better' 
HiRO/Peter O Remixes

TrAmHed's U Better made people on dancefloors across the globe very happy in it's original form. Now HiRO and Peter Otake it into deeper waters with their mixes.HiRO goes for a Kerri Chandleresque vocal led affair while Peter O rocks a simple but effective murky groove.

Spin Science 
All Things/Time To Wait 
Includes Dominic Martin Remix 
Tronicsole (TSOLE093) 

Tronicsole returns with new artist Spin Science and two tracks of deep house music ripe with soulful tones. Dominic Martin continues his long association withTronicsole, his remix confirming his reputation as one of the hotter producers around. 

Spin Science aka Ülar Aasmäe hails from Estonia. When we heard his demos we felt that there was some magic in there and together Ülar and label head honcho Stevie Sole worked together to bring that out. The end result is two firin' tracks that balance perfectly dancefloor energy with house injected full of music. As ever Dominic Martin does a sterling job giving Time To Wait a contemporary feel.

Tronicsole continues it recent run of form with this release showcasing the Brighton based new talent of Peter O. Comes packaged with a cracking Kris Wadsworth remix. 

Here is everything you need to know about Peter O: 

""I first got in to House Music in the late 1980's and I remember thinking to myself that I had found ""My Music!"" I also remember running home from school to listen to ""Centreforce FM""! I started DJing in the early 1990's and have played on the London circuit since then. I always new that I wanted to produce my own beats but it wasn't until about 7 years ago that I decided to study Music Technology and Sound Recording. Since then I have had a few tracks out and I continue to write new music every day!"" 

When we received his demos at Tronicsole, the music spoke for itself.

His music is not only great technically, wonderfully lightheaded, pop, trippy or viscerally intense at times, but also emotionally deep. It is the work of a composer in a modern contemporary way.

I was going through some of his music on SC and decided to make myself an Anthology Playlist grouping tracks from several accounts, incl. @user18081971 where he dumped a lot of great music back in 2015 and continues sporadically to do so. Many of which you can also download for free! 

This is a pretty large selection of his music, but still slightly suggestive to my tastes, I included most of what I've found here on Soundcloud though. 

It's an ongoing effort too, if you think I missed this or that track, live set, dj recording or interview, or upload something that isn't on SC yet, drop me a message with the link(s) for consideration to be added, this Playlist is for everyone to enjoy.

I started to do this for myself but soon thought I will share it to all of you music lovers, fans and people knowing only a bit of his music, but most importantly I wonder/imagine there are teenagers and young people that barely know his music, especially the very early stuff. Seeing how the 80's, 90's and 00's go through revivals and are constantly reprocessed, I realized it's important to expose Aphex Twin's work with such an Anthology Playlist on an important DJ, Producers, Listeners Platform such as Soundcloud, still a great place where there are lots you can't find on Spotify or other streaming places.

Thanks so much for the wonderful music Richard... <3

Rich holds contact with fans on @user18081971 in the threads of some of the tracks. There are also advice and FX for sampling and making music. :)

On one thread, he told people to share interesting youtube links and posted his:

Every change requires from us to overcome some trouble, easiness and sometimes even pain. By this condition our lives can go forward in a process of becoming what we are.

To those who have, are being or will have to leave their place of birth for another in order to have a better life.

To those who try to change their habits for a better place for their children.

To those who struggle to have their voices heard through their opinion or their art, in countries where silence reigns.


This album wouldn’t be possible without my family, my friends and my listeners. Infinite thanks Dears.

This album is always a relation of one to one ; like a couple, a spectator, an intervenor. It often mentions reflection, image and projection. As an analysis of the social and relational substance that makes any possible interpretation.

the mental function in which thoughts, ideas, emotions, or memories not in immediate awareness can be brought into the consciousness, usually through associations, without encountering any intrapsychic resistance or repression.

-

Dear friends and listeners,
a few words about what this album 'preconscious' and its genesis.
His first title i chose for her perfect ability to define this place in mind which arise the emotions, then the senses images, stored in memory, accessible when the process of awareness.
At the base of the project, i chose the name of my son who was still 'in the pipeline', it is this impulse that i started to work: how to welcome and get ready myself at his coming. Then i felt the need to broaden the spectrum, about the conditions necessary for this coming, approaching love, trust, endurance. Desiring to do a 'fiction' i kept the title ‘arya’ only realistic trace of this birth. So i talk about these choices, those who gather and those who separate, the various crucial stages of a relationship, the desire to remain upright, prepare and keep his way, and that which is done to my family.
From my current location as well as the cultural and generational clash that every day i measure the size, i wanted to attempt a dialogue. it certainly there's much moral in this project and i fully assume. I have the ambition to share this aspect of my life with the generations that follow, the photographic and visual choices and some of the texts are illustration of it. And to go back to the preconscious, this need has been paired with this sudden realization.
Some may find this album less researched, less dense and much less dancing than before. As some of you know, i no longer recognize myself in this square of green that is music for clubbing. This format, nor its rationale doesn’t represent me at the moment. With this album, i take off, leaving the scene that brought me so she forced me. I do not know my next destination, but hope to see you there and hopes that you will find refuge in this latest opus as a welcoming and warm.

Regards 
Van Hai

Introduction / charte

« Exile » est un projet musical, artistique et intellectuel ouvert dans le temps et l’espace, mis en œuvre pour faire face à la montée de la xénophobie et de l’intolérance en Europe et plus généralement dans les pays dits « développés ».

« Exile » n’est le fruit d’aucune idée politique de quelque aile que ce soit et n’acceptera aucune récupération. « Exile » est le fait de personnes ayant connu l’émigration pour des raisons économiques, humanitaires ou politiques. Ce projet est avant tout leur manière de partager leur expérience, leurs sentiments sur ce sujet.

En dehors de toute idéologie et religion, les œuvres présentées sont autant de messages personnels - qu’ils soient adressés à ceux qui les soutiennent, ou a ceux qui les condamnent - lancés contre le mur de l’indifférence.

Nous, producteurs et artistes exilés, prenons ainsi la liberté de parler en notre nom et de ne plus accepter que les autres le fassent à notre place pour se rendre populaires, attirer leur électorat ou vendre leurs idées.

Nous ne demandons rien d’autre en échange de l’utilisation des œuvres de ce projet que le respect de ceux qui les ont produites, en les mentionnant. Nous invitons également ceux qui le souhaitent à faire un don en faveur de la Croix-Rouge, aujourd’hui pour les exilés d’Afrique du nord et demain pour d’autres qui seront forcés de partir de chez eux, mais qui ne le savent pas encore.

Nous espérons que ce projet suscitera l’intérêt ainsi que le désir de parole chez certains jusque là silencieux ou orientés vers d’autres sujets.

Tous les détails seront accessibles prochainement depuis le site web : www.mescene.com/exile/

Conditions de participation au projet

Sera accueilli à bras ouverts celui qui a quelque chose à partager sur ce sujet, par le média de son choix mais dans le respect des lignes précédentes. Les opinions ne nous intéressent pas, nous voulons de vraies expériences.

Introduction / charter

""Exile"" is a musical, artistic and intellectual project open in time and space, initiated in response to the rise of xenophobia and intolerance in Europe and more generally in so-called ""developed"" countries.

""Exile"" is not the result of any political idea whatsoever, and will not accept any misappropriation. ""Exile"" is a creation of people who have experienced emigration for economic, humanitarian or political reasons. This project is a way to share their experiences, their feelings on this subject.

Regardless of ideology and religion, the works presented are personal messages. They are addressed to those who support, or those who condemn them - thrown against the wall of indifference.

We, producers and artists in exile, thus take the liberty to speak on our own behalf and stop accepting others to do it in order to get popular, obtain votations or sell their ideas.

We ask for nothing else in exchange for the use of these works but to respect their authors by mentioning them. We also invite those who wish to make a donation to the Red Cross to exiled persons from North Africa and for others who will be forced to leave their homes in the future.

We hope this project will make want to speak up some of those who have remained silent or were turned to other subjects.

All details will soon be available on the website:
www.mescene.com/exile/

Conditions for participation in the project

We welcome anyone who has something to share on this subject in the media of their choice, but in respect of the above-mentioned. We are not interested in opinions, we want real experiences.

Einführung/Charta

“Exile” ist ein künstlerisch-musikalisches Projekt, das räumlich und zeitlich unbegrenzt ist. Es wurde angesichts der zunehmenden Xenophobie und Intoleranz in Europa und den so genannten entwickelten Ländern ins Leben gerufen.

“Exile” entspringt keiner politischen Intention und soll nicht zu politischen Zwecken missbraucht werden.

“Exile” wird von Menschen geschaffen, die Emigration erlebt haben, sei es aus wirtschaftlichen, humanitären oder politischen Gründen. Dieses Projekt soll ihnen ermöglichen, sich auf ihre Art und Weise zu diesem Thema zu äußern.

Die vorgestellten Arbeiten sind persönliche Botschaften ohne religiöse oder ideologische Absichten. Sie richten sich an diejenigen, die ihre Autoren unterstützen oder kritisieren – ein Aufschrei gegen die Gleichgültigkeit.

Zu oft wird der Migrationsdiskurs missbraucht - wir nehmen uns die Freiheit, durch unsere Werke als Exilanten für uns selbst zu sprechen.

Die Werke sind frei zugänglich und verwendbar. Als einzige Gegenleistung bitten wir darum, dabei die Namen ihrer Autoren zu nennen. Außerdem rufen wir dazu auf, über das Rote Kreuz an heutige oder zukünftige Flüchtlinge zu spenden.

Wir hoffen, dass dieses Projekt einige betroffene dazu animiert ihr Schweigen zu brechen, oder sich mit diesem Thema zu beschäftigen.

Für Einzelheiten steht bald folgende Website zur Verfügung: www.mescene.com/exile

Bedingungen für die Beteiligung am Projekt:

Wir begrüßen jeden, der sich mit einem Beitrag im Medium seiner Wahl am Projekt beteiligen möchte, unter den oben genannten Voraussetzungen. Wir brauchen keine Meinungen, wir suchen Menschen, die selbst Exil erfahren haben.

There are stories of separation, cracks and changes 
it's raw and neat, near and far, here and there
dedicated to my family, my friends, my listeners 
my declaration of love to all those struggling to make their lives together

Have the best everything =) 
Van Hai

All tracks are written, produced and mastered by Van Hai
Saxophone on 'Rupture' is performed by Le Z

Each chain is designed from scratch per the artist's demands, which i feel out, sometimes asking for an album to match the fidelity to, or a set of albums that they admire. My rates are reasonable, i'm a friend and have had clients at every stage of their careers - have worked with small labels, netlabels, and majors alike.

Inner Horizons is debut album from Jukka Varis under artist name Introvert - music project which has been around from 2003. Sound is  diverse, roughly put together, natural warm electronics where instruments have life of their own forming interesting melodic  adventures. Inner Horizons is colorful journey through seasons powered by psychedelics of infinite mirror images from timeless dusty sundowns.

On remix duty is Chocky, no stranger to the scene with several releases on labels like Big Bait or Steve Bug’s Dessous Recordings.

The titles of the tracks expresses Estroe's love for nature. Myosotis Arvensis (Field Forget Me Not) and Tanacetum Parthenium (Feverfew) are two of her favourite flowers which bloom in June, the month of the release date.

Two highly regarded friends and fellow producers were invited for the remix honours, Berlin based Glitterbug and (music) BFF Nadia Struiwigh.

Estroe's original mix of Myosotis Arvensis starts with a simple but intriguing bassline and slowly builds amidst delicate, melodic patterns and lush, orchestral strings as if the flowers themselves are opening one by one. Her natural sense of groove prevails in the bassline throughout this meadow of fresh, early summer sound.

Tanacetum Parthenium (original) has an edgier feel to it. Again it is groove driven by a distinctive bassline but is awash with a tense, almost organic background and with darker percussive shots. Brooding orchestral swells bring to the track a sense of salient anxiety.

Glitterbug's Desperate Times remix of Myosotis Arvensis has an orchestral and cinematic quality. Deep sustained bass notes and a fluid and metallic rhythm drive this track along elegantly. The smooth solemn strings and glistening pads wrap this track in a cloak of sonic grace.

His other remix on the ep, Glitterbug's That Very Moment remix is a sublime piece of aural architecture. Ambient, emotional and with a heartbeat bass drum, it encapsulates the very moment one is struck by the tranquillity of seeing something beautiful. The strings in this track ebb and flow like serene breaths of cool air whilst the soft piano shimmers like early morning dew.

Always one to explore the deeper side of a track, like a botanist in a lab, Nadia Struiwigh dissects the original Tanacetum Parthenium and creates a remix which exemplifies her style. She creates a dark and pulsating mix of throbbing bass drums, cavern like reverbs and ominous, overdriven grooves that build the track perfectly.

The sixteen volumes eventually became a podcast, and then, somewhere along the way, Headphone Commute was born. The rest, as they say, is history. 

I nearly forgot about these mixes, as the remnants of poorly encoded files slowly disappeared from the internet archives. That is... until now... Nearly by accident, I was able to locate all of the 16 Volumes in their original lossless resolution on one of my dusty hard drives!!! 

These are now being released, one at a time, for all your guilty pleasures, to celebrate the sounds of electronica from the good ol' days :)"	23132105	all	Electronic	608258691	playlist		2019-04-13T05:58:07Z	all-rights-reserved	66	False	liftmuziek-sessions	https://soundcloud.com/headphonecommute/sets/liftmuziek-sessions	True				9		public		liftmuziek sessions	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/608258691	2302		False	2018-09-22T08:48:28Z	2018-09-22T08:48:28Z	6	503472768,526503345,533264481,544257708,574042722,605298432

As night falls, the road before you unfolds. Slowly, all the bustle dissipates. Tarmac becomes visible, the horizon changes colour: evening comes. Time to consider your journey, time for music. This is where this album originates and this is where it is heading. Thought leads to music and music leads to thought. Inspiration, action and reaction. The passing of time is the context. Where are you coming from and where are you going to? May these be interesting times.	4240533	all	Electronic	830525597	playlist		2019-07-21T17:01:20Z	all-rights-reserved	5	False	interesting-times	https://soundcloud.com/terrace/sets/interesting-times	True			2005-10-21T00:00:00Z	0		public		Interesting Times	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/830525597	2314	album	True	2019-07-21T17:01:20Z	2019-07-21T17:01:20Z	10	654352550,654352538,654352535,654352529,654352511,654352508,654352499,654352493,654352478,654352466

From the layered complex drum patterns of Inspiria, to the dreamy armchair journey of Into Deep Space and to the driving, almost clubby The Scream, this album has it all for the discerning listener. A little stab at the rave scene in The Scream is provided by the lyric ""One day you will be half-dead begging for a decent meal - if only you had listened instead of dancing like an imbecil (sic)"". Very pointed Stefan - but some of us always listened to your music!

A excellent fusion of European/Detroit influenced 90's techno with drum-melodic characteristics of Idm, along with ambient flourishes and some cool intelligent use of techno-breakbeat,delivering a creative post-modern si-fi listen with a solid electronic/techno foundation that keeps this album interesting throughout without failure. This is a sort of album that would not be out of place from Warp's own classi Artifical Intelligence series - you can certainly relate to the AI feel and sound onthis album. Today (2018+) `Occcurance’ remains a great album with music that will manage to stimulate the mind, the soul & the body while complementing everything good about techno without depending on repetition or harshness in its sound.. This is quality techno in every sense that should be placed along with classic known techno albums that were ahead of there time but still remain a joy to listen today.	3952057	all	Electronic	830499740	playlist		2019-07-21T16:14:40Z	all-rights-reserved	9	False	occurences	https://soundcloud.com/terrace/sets/occurences	True			1997-07-01T00:00:00Z	0		public	Techno Melodictechno	Occurences	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/830499740	2314	album	True	2019-07-21T16:14:40Z	2019-07-21T16:14:40Z	10	654334970,654334958,654334949,654334934,654334913,654334907,654334898,654334886,654334880,654334871

For NOW Gallery's Design Commission Fred has created a joyful destination for healing with light, colour, shape and sound. Headphones are available to experience a sonic journey by Natureboy Flako created for the exhibition. He combines live instrumentation, synthesizers and his own voice in a series of rich, reflective and detailed compositions. The contrasting tempos, textures and moods reflect the many facets of Fred Butler’s exploration of the senses.""

This is a side project over 10 years in the making, and it's the most personal music I've ever made. I encourage you to listen privately, at least initially. As with any story, the sequence of events is important.

This is original work inspired by movie scores. These previews take you behind the scenes and focus on specific layers of the songs. Consider it an advanced screening."	0	all	Soundtrack	357428009	playlist		2018-09-27T01:59:21Z	all-rights-reserved	3	False	still-frame-capture-directors-cuts	https://soundcloud.com/robdowell/sets/still-frame-capture-directors-cuts	True				1		public	"""Artist Album"" Ambient Electronica ""Film Score"""	Still Frame Capture [Director's Cuts]	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/357428009	2436		False	2017-10-04T12:26:27Z	2017-10-04T12:26:27Z	0

Recognized by some as a creative force in House Music,
Dimitri Max has managed to hold a spot in today’s list of
producers to watch out for. Recently receiving notice from
Toolroom boss Mark Knight, Berlin’s Oliver $ and the
legendary Dj Jazzy Jeff. The signs all point to Mr. Max
must be doing something right and we couldn’t be more
proud to have him be part of the Sampled Detroit family.
Today we are announcing his next burner of a release
(drum-roll) “Burning You” with a big bad bassline and a
driving vocal that will have you burning inside. This
package comes complete with a no non-sense peak time
floor filler from head honcho Chuck Daniels and a darker
roast early morning, tech-house rider from our latest signin
Mathew K. Finally, if you like a mutha fuckin’ mix.. well
DMax got your back with a break infused 90s drum and
bass inspired mix to seal the deal. This package has
proven itself on the dance floor and we are excited to
finally share it with you."	519594	all	Tech House	37051028	playlist		2015-10-13T14:53:11Z	all-rights-reserved	9	False	burning-you-out-june-2nd	https://soundcloud.com/dimitrimax/sets/burning-you-out-june-2nd	True		http://www.beatport.com/release/burning-you/1304985	2014-06-02T00:00:00Z	1		public	Tech House Burner Wobble Bass Dirty Booty Sweat Nasty DC Detroit Sriracha	"""Burning You"" Out Now"	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/37051028	2496	ep	True		2014-05-28T21:38:29Z	3	151305340,151567195,151604502

Compared to the more playful debut, Socket Science slows things down on the follow up Ephedra. Three dark, distorted and long jams that focus on the lower frequencies yet remain true to the core idea, being Robot Music with Soul.

It's easy to envision lined up drones doing their monotonic labour in dirty factories. However, these pieces of music also carry the reverberation of their children playing on the school yard across the street, as well as the moans and squeaks of the community elders in need of an oil tin refreshment. Everyone's invited, everyone plays a part.

And not to forget; all these influences and emotions are packed upon a quite steady and bouncy beat.

5 Mag CHICAGO: ""Deep Core: A month with Malcolm Moore's Long Awaited Album"" https://5mag.net/tracks/new-releases/malcolm-moore-deep-core/
Juno: 'Minneapolis deep house veteran Malcolm Moore returns to his own label Altered Moods with another blissful excursion into the farthest realms of smoked-out expression. It takes but a moment to sink into ""Everydaelife"" and place this sound - the kind of pattering rhythm sections and powerfully melancholic chords that you'd expect from the likes of Dubbyman, Anton Zap or Ron Trent. Moore has his own take on things though, bringing a blown out jack to the table on ""Own The Nite (90s House Rescrub)""and creating a moving, downtempo funk on ""Lunchtime Gaze"". The more forthright grooves are impeccable too though - ""Rodalies R1"" hits every sweet spot a deep house lover could wish for.'"	1251402	all	Deep House	724413129	playlist		2020-04-16T00:40:10Z	all-rights-reserved	48	False	amr-40l-malcolm-moore-deep	https://soundcloud.com/alteredmoods/sets/amr-40l-malcolm-moore-deep	True				11		public	"""drum n bass"" 90s deephouse chill laidback breaky sexiswish"	AMR-40L Malcolm Moore - Deep Core	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/724413129	2508		False	2019-03-31T09:33:50Z	2019-03-31T09:33:50Z	11	586275345,598663101,586275555,598881003,598677762,598678608,598678854,602584356,598679016,598680210,598679181

""The main threads of Shiny Silver Lining are those things that come along the way that you didn’t envision in the first place. It’s a change of scenery, transitions, change of seasons, things that get lost, replacing the old veins by growing new arteries and paths, feeling lost in translation, feeling foreign in the familiarity. The color of transformation. It’s about finding positivity in things that get worn out and seeing the good things of dark brooding clouds and waves that are 100 feet high that keep on coming to crush you and all you can do is float.""

From the sweaty mechanical cyclo funk of Col D’Aubisque and the deep menacing synthetic growl of Dissolver, through the offworld voltaic symphony of Infinite Unknowns to the final devastating electro slapdown of the title track, this is a perfect example of Matt’s unique blend of Detroit, Chicago & UK electronics.  	1468941	all	Techno / Electro 	19053	playlist	11th Hour Recordings	2015-10-13T13:39:39Z	all-rights-reserved	0	False	matt-chester-die-for-a-reason-ep-11th-hour-recordings-ehr007	https://soundcloud.com/11thhour/sets/matt-chester-die-for-a-reason-ep-11th-hour-recordings-ehr007	True			2009-06-20T00:00:00Z	0		public	"""detroit chicago dub melodic funk electro techno london uk soul"""	Matt Chester - Die For A Reason EP (11th Hour Recordings ehr007)	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/19053	2568	ep	True		2009-06-06T16:47:03Z	4	317281,317282,317283,317284

On the flip, ‘Cold Restraint’ is a straight out dancefloor bomb - tough driving percussion threaded with a distorted bleep hook and searing strings, all pushed forward by one of the nastiest basslines around; whilst ‘Down and Out in EC2′ provides a deep, driving and endlessly shiftingelectro workout.

This release is already getting rave reviews from press and public worldwide, with DJ magazine making it ‘Electro single of the month’ Feb 09 and Update naming it ‘Essential single of the month’, as well as featuring in M8, Fact, Mixmag and many others. It is getting strong DJ support from Laurent Garnier,UR, Fabrice Lig, Mark Broom and many more…"	1458492	all	Techno / Electro	946	playlist	11th Hour Recordings	2015-10-13T13:39:26Z	all-rights-reserved	1	False	matt-chester-endless-days-ep-ehr006	https://soundcloud.com/11thhour/sets/matt-chester-endless-days-ep-ehr006	True			2009-02-16T00:00:00Z	1		public		Matt Chester - Endless Days EP (ehr006)	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/946	2568	ep	True		2008-09-16T19:50:45Z	3	27539,27530,27534

Videoclip Muaco by VJ Lilitxt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvNYF_Hu5HU


In 2021 CLIKNO celebrates its 5th anniversary and presents with its 10th release a very special acoustic techno EP from Dr.Nojoke entitled “Muaco.

This EP is a child of the Corona crisis. Muaco stands for Music against Corona and deals with the clubless time we are all experiencing.

When Dr.Nojoke picked up his Höfner acoustic guitar during the lockdown in spring he was looking for new inspirations. The recordings led to three brilliant poly-rhythmical tracks for a special trip far off the beaten path.
Dr.Nojoke suggests his EP as much as a way for home-clubbing as well as a listening experience.

We don´t even know, if it is techno or what, but as mostly all parts were created with acoustic guitar you may file it under acoustic techno or guitar techno.
We think it is just great groovy music - pulsating, hypnotic, danceable, kraut-ish, freaky - that should be played everywhere."	1176164	all	Techno	1207118911	playlist		2021-02-23T10:30:10Z	all-rights-reserved	3	False	dr-nojoke-muaco-clikno-d05	https://soundcloud.com/dr-nojoke/sets/dr-nojoke-muaco-clikno-d05	True		https://clikno.bandcamp.com/album/muaco	2021-01-29T00:00:00Z	1		public	"""Minimal Techno"" clikno Acoustic ""acoustic guitar"" electronica ""electronic music"" ""deep techno"" hypnotic ""kraut techno"" ""organic techno"""	Dr.Nojoke - Muaco [CLIKNO D05]	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1207118911	2698	ep	True	2021-02-06T15:07:57Z	2021-02-06T15:07:57Z	3	977556283,977556277,977556253

All music was created with a Farfisa Compact organ, effects and a mixing desk. No overdubs, no mastering, just as rough as recorded!

Why Drones & Tones For the Free?
In these times of growing fears I'd like to give in something to think and meditate on. Drones & Tones For The Free can be understood as an abstract title, but I really mean it literally: it's about freedom!
Free are those, who free their hearts and souls from fear, hate, anger, greed, jealousy ... We have to free us from fascism, racism, sexism ... and any kind of oppressive and manipulative act, which is build on inequality and on the system of fear, that creates even more fear, through which people control others.
We cannot accept that.
It is obviously just so wrong.

I think we can be free only, when we fight our fears, when we manage to become independent from the sources of fear. Fear makes us blind.
We must free our hearts and minds to act and think without preoccupations and prejudices, to be open, to feel responsible, feel empathy and act socially again.
It really starts with everyone.

Drones & Tones For The Free is an invitation and a call to start with it right now!"	4399908	all	Ambient	1151984390	playlist		2020-10-26T21:08:05Z	all-rights-reserved	5	False	anomali-drones-tones-for-the	https://soundcloud.com/dr-nojoke/sets/anomali-drones-tones-for-the	True	get it on Bandcamp	https://microrama.bandcamp.com/album/anomali-drones-tones-for-the-free-ii	2020-09-19T00:00:00Z	1		public	Experimental Meditative Drone Electronic Soundscape	Anomali - Drones & Tones For The Free II	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1151984390	2698	album	True	2020-10-26T20:59:32Z	2020-10-26T20:59:32Z	2	896002096,896002054

AI.
The second output in the MAT editions series on CLIKNO is a bass-heavy affair over four sides by Dr.Nojoke. Separated into the EPs “Anonymity” and “Intimacy” it is due to be released on August 7th, 2020.
The digital world and social media in particular change our perception and behavior; our values and morals undergo a transformation and shift. How much are we still anonymous? How much are we still intimate (with us/with others)? What does anonymity and intimacy mean to us today?

MUSIC.
Dr.Nojoke shows on AI his deeper, darker, bassier and trippier side.
A. Petar Plet Plete is based on a Bulgarian tongue twister. The chant hypnotizes with its layers and endless repetitions over a straight Maurizio-esque groove with melodic percussion in odd time signature. Nivin grooves elegantly with typical Dr.Nojoke clicks and sophisticated loops of a mysterious female voice, whose melody reminds slightly to Kraftwerk’s Man-machine era.
I. EOW and Nuknot are both intimate orgies of thick textures of reverberations and reflections as if space is folding in itself and time is on hold. EOW seduces with a heavy kick-drum groove and a triplet bassline underneath crawling through unconscious memories. Woe! Nuknot is carried by eternal atmospheres, a low end bassline and a repetitious glassy clang, that can drive a crowd into madness - inspired by Moritz von Oswald and Deadbeat. Nuknot ends in an ambient lock groove

ART.
CLIKNO curates artworks from living artists. For MAT ed.02 we are proud to present digital artist Lucas Gutierrez and his work “Your Mesh.sgl”, originally part of the exhibition ▬ Knowledge Of ▬ at Aperto Raum Berlin, 2017.

Stepping up with a trio of his signature oneiric, mind-expanding wares, Eddie takes us on an odyssey-like voyage into the deeper end of techno’s atmospheric spectrum, making the rounds from alien-engineered architectonics towards velveteen, near-lounge-y abstraction.

The journey begins with “Towards A Dream” - a self-revealing roller beaming us up to far-flung Saturnian lands as it unfolds a slo-hatching meshwork of sun-washed pads, raucous bass work and boggy 303 talk. Rising the pressure a notch further, “High Virgo” is a laser-guided weapon aimed at subjugating dance-floors through steadfast onslaughts of delayed drums, gut-churning kicks and Eddie's typical hi-intensity synth hoodoo from outer-space. Last but not least, UY co-founder Marco Resmann adds his havoc-wreaking, dynamic spin to “Towards A Dream”, turning the dreamy original into a full-fledged club destroyer, primed for ruff n'tuff peak time action. Equally at ease in an open-air setting or busting kneecaps in the darkness of a jam-packed basement."	1375138	all	Techno	1327096786	playlist	Upon You Records	2021-10-06T11:52:32Z	all-rights-reserved	7	False	eddie-merced-towards-a-dream	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/eddie-merced-towards-a-dream	True			2021-10-01T00:00:00Z	4		public	"""Eddie Merced"" ""Towards A Dream"" ""Marco Resmann"" Remix EP Single ""Upon You Records"" ""Deep House"" Techno ""Melodic House"" ""Melodic Techno"""	Eddie Merced - Towards A Dream	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1327096786	2746	single	True	2021-10-06T11:52:31Z	2021-10-06T11:52:31Z	3	1136907382,1136907361,1136907346

While 'Glossolalia's thumping, heads-down beat locks you into an airtight vacuum from the go, Daniela Rhodes' beguiling vocal slithers soon guide us into a shimmering landscape of dubbed-out synths and craftly placed effects. These are only brought to the fore by label-head Marco Resmann on his 'Re-Edit One'. Here, a chunky metallic groove unspools into an echo-chamber of infinite depth. In contrast, Resmann's 'Re-Edit Two' ups the ante by adding a neon-synth overload to the mix, making for an equally immersive result. On 'Backpfeifengesicht' Collate then strips things down for the after-hour, letting disoriented bleeps tap-dance over a hugely satisfying minimalist framework, reminding us of the early 90s sound-axis between Berlin and the north of England. Lastly, Collate activates the bunker vibes by way of 'Awumbuk', concluding a powerful EP with a viciously moreish bomb. This one's for those bleary-eyed moments we've come to miss so much. Let's enjoy them while we can.	2093897	all	House	1320830305	playlist	Upon You Records	2021-09-23T18:50:33Z	all-rights-reserved	9	False	collate-visions-of-clarity	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/collate-visions-of-clarity	True	Stream / Download	https://fanlink.to/collate_visions_of_clarity	2021-09-03T00:00:00Z	1		public	"""Upon You Records"" Collate ""Daniela Rhodes"" ""Marco Resmann"" ""Deep House"" ""Tech House"" Techno Release Remix Edit"	Collate - Visions Of Clarity	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1320830305	2746	ep	True	2021-09-23T18:50:32Z	2021-09-23T18:50:32Z	5	1129950067,1129950043,1129950022,1129950007,1129949986

Of course we are talking about Eins Tiefer, the famed duo comprised of Vincent Probst and Nico Bulla, who are set and well ready to unleash their latest musical outing via Upon.You Records these days which is their four track single called „Retrograde“.

Starting their musical journey with „Sliced“ the dynamic duo comes in on a surprisingly deep and tender tip, fusing a slow, yet still TechHouse-leaning foundation with super soft, carefully arranged pad structures and multiple layers of African chants – a combination for late night sets in small, intimate club settings and defo one that might cause a bit of an Ambient House revival to come, transferring this classic term into a new and contemporary context.

Subsequently Eins Tiefer are bringing forth „Flurry“ which defo feels more at home on the dark side with its brooding, analogue basslines and eerie crackles atop a still tender and subdued beat foundation, contrasting this innate darkness with a playful, friendly and uplifting synth motif which makes itself at home right in the very center of every punters heart.

The title cut that is „Retrograde“ provides more of a muscular and well distinct dancefloor cut, drawing influences both from skeletal TechHouse as well as MinimalTechno whilst pairing a spatial, scintillating and ever changing synth melody with subdued, yet ever present muscular low end to a well hypnotic and time dissolving effect.

Finally, the closing tune „Lights“ indulges in futuristic, perfectly sculpted contemporary TechHouse sounds with its tense, ever evolving elements flickering in the dim neon lights of underground venues like reflections on polished chrome, providing a well thrilling setting for club nights and future movie scores alike."	1720007	all	Electronic	1265239585	playlist	Upon You Records	2021-05-31T08:23:29Z	cc-by	18	False	eins-tiefer	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/eins-tiefer	True	Stream + Download	https://fanlink.to/ET_Retrograde	2021-05-28T00:00:00Z	7		public	"""Eins Tiefer"" ""Upon You Records"" Retrograde"	Eins Tiefer	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1265239585	2746	ep	True	2021-05-31T08:19:59Z	2021-05-31T08:19:59Z	4	1058932891,1058932870,1058932855,1058932807

We're talking Kotelett & Sascha Cawa here who are presenting their conjunctional label debut that is „Akemie"" with two original tracks and a dubbed out retake of the title cut.

With „Akemie"" we see Kotelett & Sascha Cawa provide a deep and highly fascinating dancefloor banger, pairing a precisely sculpted TechHouse foundation with a well hypnotic, slightly modulated main motif accompanied by an evergrowing stack of intertwined, corresponding synth layers leading towards the most angelic widescreen panorama breakdown you'll experience on a large scale P.A. system this year.

Subsequently „Takeshi"" is shifting gears and enters full throttle mode whilst the prolific duo navigates a brooding, well futuristic sonic realm, firing up dancefloors with a clean cut, more muscular and surely spine-tingling, Techno-leaning sound vision balancing the thin line between a looming apocalypse and an oncoming salvation, perfectly represented by the tunes glistening melodies.

Finally, the title track makes a second appearance in its so-called „Akemie *Dub"" version, providing an even deeper and slightly moodier variation for extended (Neo)Trance-oriented after hours sets and open air sunrise sessions under immaculate skies for a closing."	1181649	all	Electronic	1250075305	playlist	Upon You Records	2021-04-30T08:48:55Z	cc-by	28	False	kotelett-sascha-cawa	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/kotelett-sascha-cawa	True	Download / Stream	https://fanlink.to/Akemie	2021-04-30T00:00:00Z	8		public	"""Upon You Records"" Kotelett ""Sascha Cawa"" Akemie"	Kotelett & Sascha Cawa	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1250075305	2746	single	True	2021-04-30T08:41:44Z	2021-04-30T08:41:44Z	3	1039725547,1039725535,1039725514

If this is what makes an artist a pillar of a labels roster Vienna-based artist T Raum has officially reached this status with „Evil"" which is his latest EP on Upon.You Records and our first transmission for the year 2k21.

Opening with „Get Ready"" T Raum is sending a clear signal to anyone preparing for things to come on future dancefloors which are, at least according to this furious entree, about to be jam-packed with bodies moving along to brooding, relentless and well eerie Techno grooves revolving around a busy midrange synth, hefty snare attacks and warped vocal transmissions from the outerworld.

Getting loads of „Recognition"" is what the second tune on this four tracker deserves due to its cold and tripping, sci-fi and slightly psychedelic TechHouse vibe paired with emulations of icy winds being blown over from exoterrestrial plains, ever morphing modulation sequences and, once again, disembodied vocal bits drilling deep down into the human subconscious.

Furthermore „Evil"" lurks within the title track which caters a deep, stripped down and masterly crafted take on spaced out Acid minimalism structurally reminiscent of a vibe brought to us by many mid- and early 90s classics before an intense, swirling, psyched out and siren'esque synth layer starts to drift, wobble and morph through the stereo field for additional braincell stimulation.

And finally there is „Breath Control"" - a reference to these strange times we're living in titlewise, catering a musical menu comprised of a dark and claustrophic 2k21-reinterpretation of minimalistic Shuffle Techno garnished with more hypercold sci-fi vibes, spine-tingling sample abuse and ever shifting - and phase-shifting - movements of micro-motifs within the stereo field, adding additional depths to devastating klaxon'esque synth signals and what seems to be an out of the loop metronome playing an essential role in this sonic trip through space and time."	1713893	all	Techno	1217505934	playlist	Upon You Records	2021-03-04T18:28:33Z	all-rights-reserved	10	False	t-raum-evil	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/t-raum-evil	True	Stream / Download	http://fanlink.to/TRaum_Evil		1		public	"""T Raum"" ""Upon You Records"" Evil"	T Raum - Evil	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1217505934	2746		False	2021-02-26T10:58:42Z	2021-02-26T10:58:42Z	4	991966126,998608279,998608414,998608381

Coming in as a final transmission from the Upon.You Records camp in 2k20 and a definitive statement straight from the studio of the labels creative mastermind Marco Resmann is his new seven track mini album „Past / Future“.

Inspired by and entirely crafted throughout the COVID-19 induced lockdown that held, and still holds, the entire nightlife industry captive alongside big parts of the music business both facing massive losses with a certainly uncertain future ahead the tracks on „Past / Future“ both reminisce and reflect about the state of an entire scene, how it used to and how – if, when and whenever... – it will be at a point humanity has overcome the global pandemic.

„Past / Future“ is Marco Resmann's musical statement at the end of a strange year in which electronic music was bereft of its natural habitat, dancefloor functionality was rendered redundant and forcefully displaced to a new reality of home- and headphone consumption and streaming sets.

Opening with „Save The Night“ for an intro the Berlin-based producer weighs in a clear message, repeated over and over again by various warped and twisted voices backed by soft, organic and somewhat dubbed out 4/4 foundation providing us with a memory of what once used to be.

The title cut „Past / Future“ featuring vocalist Tony Philips draws inspiration from both deepest DubTechno realms and track'ish, raw and ever filtered (Deep)House rhythm signatures for extended late night sessions whilst paying homage to the long, ever meandering tracks and structures filed under the flag of Intelligent Techno back in the days.


„Nevertheless“ sees Marco Resmann shifting gears to reach full on dancefloor mode, once again amalgamating a driving, yet stripped down and expertly filtered uptempo TechHouse vibe with a wide variety of DubTechno-leaning elements whilst opening up large scale realms with the tunes' beautifully hypnotic main synth line.
Riding the „Wave“ Marco Resmann explores a highly futuristic Sci-Fi Ambient realm of cold, score'esque qualities, fusing the vastness of deep space with warped modular bleeps and echoes of echoes of the Berlin School / ProtoAmbient movement with its histroy harking way back to the 70s even.

„Lost In Space“ is an excursion into the grey area bordering Broken Techno, Electro, Post- Dubstep and various incarnations of Bass Music in general, all glued together by a highly seductive swing, mutated scratches and raw, overwhelming vintage bass waves which turn this one into a timeless future classic within seconds.

The subsequent „Exit“ follows with even more swirling raw vintage bass greatness, backed by a seductive TechHouse groove, ever tweaked high frequency feedbacks and beautiful harmonies, all leading towards a lively, captiving main motif ready to take, at this time: imaginery, dancefloors by storm in combination with the tunes Trance-influenced string and pad sections.

Finally „Belief“ embarks on a journey towards a faint, yet existing silver lining at the horizon with its bubbly, ever sparkling synth cascades and emotionally touching chords backed by what is best to be described as the love child of TechHouse and (Neo)Trance for a closing."	1687955	all	Techno	1180067416	playlist	Upon You Records	2020-12-17T14:28:25Z	all-rights-reserved	13	False	marco-resmann-past-future-mini	https://soundcloud.com/uponyourecords/sets/marco-resmann-past-future-mini	True	Beatport / Spotify	https://fanlink.to/PastFuture		5		public	"""Marco Resmann"" ""Past Future"" ""Mini LP"" ""Upon You Records"""	Marco Resmann - Past Future (Mini LP)	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1180067416	2746		False	2020-12-17T13:48:40Z	2020-12-17T13:48:40Z	7	949359397,949359757,943619260,949359967,949358449,949360477,949360600

The 8 track EP is Discobelle Records first foray outside of electronic dance music and we're truly excited to showcase this unique sounding EP.

""Flat Feet Beat Suite"" is bouncy and playful, chopped and twisted organic sounding beats that will definitely put a stride in your step and all the tracks corresponds to an imaginary dance routine.

The EP was mastered by skweee pioneer Tatu Metsätähti (Mesak, Mr Velcro Fastener, Ya Tosiba).

Cassette copies of the EP are available via Zeon Light:

The festival will be on this August 22 and 23rd, and while so many of the Festivals in Southern California happen in “the greater Los Angeles area (Indio, Palm Springs, San Bernadino, Pomona), this one happens to be directly in the city at the The LA Sports Arena & Exposition Park.

""Gone"" showcases a new direction for Caotico, a massive track leaning heavily towards a pulsating UK garage beat that's interspersed with robotic vocals making this a dancefloor bomb, the club edit makes that even more certain and should be your next weapon of choice. 

Fellow Swedes @franskild churns out a housey remix thick with Scandinavian melancholia, the vocals are turned into a haunting affair all while the deep beat is sprinkled with hi-hats and desolate bleeps. 

Toronto outfit @RYMEonRYME rides high on their streak of bumping house/techno tracks with this steadfast remix on which they replace most of the vocals with a single echoed yelp and transplants the track with the help of cinematic synths into more of a 6AM jam for all you late night revelers out there."	1087368	all	Caotico	109190939	playlist	Discobelle Records	2015-10-13T15:13:25Z	all-rights-reserved	38	False	caotico-gone	https://soundcloud.com/discobelle/sets/caotico-gone	True	Buy/Stream	http://DiscobelleRecords.lnk.to/dbr036Gone	2015-05-19T00:00:00Z	13		public	"""Discobelle Records"" House Caotico RYME franskild"	Caotico - Gone	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/109190939	2772	ep	True		2015-05-19T19:04:49Z	4	201684196,206247616,206247828,206247999

""Reflecting over new life, Krasch 3 takes inspiration from a future untold.

Noah Gibson returns with a different and more reflective atmosphere. Standing at one point at the dawn of a bright tomorrow: new life. Paired with a technologically backlashed futuristic city scape: piles of illuminated displays, desolate buildings that stand tall as a symbol of a former glory. ‘Krasch 3’ is a scenery with different takes on the same theme.

‘Edge of Tomorrow’, ‘Emerge’ and ‘Route I’ symbolize the brightness where ‘City Entrance’, ‘Backstreet’ and ‘Route II’ brings us a dystopian vision of the next tomorrow.

What we have is a solid return.

A2. Vohkinne – Vestigial Structures
B1. Vohkinne – Device One (Ritualistic) 
B2. Material Object – Grindr

For Atrophic Society's 10th release, simply titled ""X"", Material Object has delved into his archives to uncover a previously unreleased co-production with Audio Injection in the form of ""Cwejack"". Effectual and triumphant. marching forward with purpose. A treasure. A perfect fit.

""Grindr"", Material object's other contribution, takes us to the wild edge of sonic exploration and back again. Music poised to push us into the abyss with acidic snarls and overwhelming drones, a writhing black sea swallowing everything in it's path.

Married with Vohkinne's ""Vestigial Structures"" and ""Device One (Risualistic)"", the theme of the EP takes shape. Non-standard music for non-standard people. X marks the spot. Get lost, drown, buried deep. Go beyond.

Vinyl & digital in May 2018.

A2: Savas Pascalidis - Resonate (Echologist Cover Mix)
B1: Savas Pascalidis - Resonate
B2: Savas Pascalidis - Subminimal

Savas Pascalidis releases heavy new EP ‘Brain Waves’ on Atrophic Society
 
Savas Pascalidis is an artist who needs little in the way of introduction. Having a career that spans the last 25 years, and releases on a staggering number of great labels (Gigolo Records, Kurbel, Non Series, Mote Evolver, Stockholm LTD, Children of Tommorow, Skudge, Figure and many more), we’re proud to welcome Savas to the Atrophic Society family.

Brain Waves sees further exploration of the techno that defines Savas’ sound. Savage, grooving and dripping in nuance, all four cuts on this EP will set the night on fire.

Distant Dreams is a tunnelling beast that twists and turns over itself with insistent percussive slaps and grooving bass, underpinning a driving synth line that stacks up to create a furious EP opener.

There were no parts to work from to make a remix with, so in a total class move Echologist drops a cover mix of the B1 track Resonate, though it could be said that it’s inspired by all the original tracks on the EP. He strips it back to the bare necessities and propels it forward in true Echologist style.

The original of Resonate is noisey and blustery as the title would suggest, hissing and bleeping over a mid range bassline that tastefully peaks and troughs for the length of the journey. Finally, rounding out the EP in total class, Subminimal crescendo’s with layers of noise and delay over a funk-fuelled rhythm.

All four tracks on this forward thinking EP for Atrophic Society are essential machine-made music and an outstanding addition to Savas’ body of work.

Following releases on Detroit Underground, Nachtstrom Schallplatten, Planet Rhythm and BluePrint Records, Gotshell releases his first EP on Atrophic Society.
 
The Colombian aficionado has been making waves across the world for his uncompromising take on the darker side of techno. His new EP ‘Quarkcima’ is no different, with a thick slice of bass-heavy machine music made for late night body moving.
 
‘Quarkcima’ follows a bleepy lead with layers of bass, building to a satisfying and tasteful crescendo, which steers clear of the tropes and uses frequencies to their fullest. It invokes a dark and foreboding atmosphere like a creeping black fog.
 
First on remix duty is Xhin, who takes the bleepy synth lead and twists it into a heavy-but-funky robotic jam, stark and cold on the surface but with plenty of heat underneath. 
 
Jeff Derringer takes the reins for the second remix, wielding the original parts masterfully into a dense, bassline-driven triplet groove that takes the vibe up a few notches. 
 
Finally, label head Vohkinne adds punch and percussion to his charged and clanging remix, which rounds out a fierce package in style.
 
‘Quarkcima’ is four cuts of essential techno that will never leave your crate.

Utliising a library of field recordings the two captured in their respective back yards. they’ve crafted a sonic pallet using only those sounds, which serves to give a tangible cohesion across the EP as well as provide something a little different from the norm. Each track captures a unique set of machine sounds and turns them into brooding, heady, atmospheric techno. A Thousand Cuts and Scythe serve as heavy hitters, whereas Nature Control and Broad Swathe to the Far Side bring a dark mood seething with anticipation.

Label head Vohkinne steps up to the plate again with the sweaty and headstrong 3rd release from Atrophic Society, ‘Creole Rhythm’. It’s concrete rhythm, combined with an analogue lead riff stirs echoes of warehouses, insistently driving forward, mindful of where it’s been. Tripeo remixes the title track with gusto and flair as we’ve come to expect, staying faithful to the riff whilst aggressively re-paving the rhythm, offering a slight twist on the original idea. Rounding out the EP, ‘Be Like the Sun’ removes the rhythm to focus on tone, frequency, shades of sub bass and saturation.

One of Europe's key figures in the drum and bass music scene of the 2000s - Sunchase - returns with his long-awaited album on Kashtan, a newly launched label from Ukraine, on 1st of December 2020.
Kashtan arises with the release of the renowned Ukrainian producer Sunchase, aka Alexander Pavlenko, whose debut album, 'Static Nitro', came out on Drone Audio in 2010. Sunchase had numerous singles on such cult labels like Moving Shadow, Metalheadz and Hospital Records and after 10 years he finally returns to the LP format.
His second album 'Timeline', just like the concept of the label, blurs the boundaries between genres of electronic music, and cannot be assigned to any particular style. The melancholic and abstract sounds give off a sense of reclusiveness, with drum and bass rhythms peeking and sometimes breaking through to the surface, yet more often they go deeper, creating room for bass music, dub and even a slight touch of IDM, thus creating a very special state. The album as a whole appears as a voluminous, complete, and aesthetically established piece of work.

Kashtan is a new Ukrainian record label. The primal concept of the label is to discover and to pick carefully gems of Ukrainian electronic music that are not defined and limited by genre definitions. The selection focuses on pure creativity, aiming for the listener to return again and again, despite shifts in trends and time. It was created and developed by Vera Logdanidi, a Kyiv-based producer and DJ, one of the founders of the Rhythm Büro project. Vera has been hosting a radio show on the waves of Kyiv's independent project 20ft Radio for over three years now. The show consists mainly of unreleased tracks by Ukrainian electronic producers. Kashtan assists in presenting not very known musicians to a global audience and places them on the same level with already established producers, whilst also revealing their creative personalities. The community that is quickly forming around Kashtan is constantly replenished with new blood and fresh ideas where musicians exchange personal experiences and ideas.
The releases of Kashtan will be executed in a rather unusual format: it will be a limited series of collectible packs, including a USB stick with music and additional multimedia content, as well as other materials. These packs can later be collected into a catalog. Also, the LP will be released digitally on Kashtan's Bandcamp page and all other known online stores.

Pavlenko has been making music for nearly 20 years, most notably under the alias Sunchase. With the latter project, he was known in the drum and bass world as something of a child prodigy, but more recently Pavlenko started applying his artistry towards soundscapes that can be filed into the techno category. In the last four years he’s been first and foremost involved with Rhythm Büro, a techno initiative, party series and label from Kiev, Ukraine, that has since become well-regarded among DJs and dancers internationally.

This EP marks Na Nich's first solo EP, following a track featured on Semantica Records’ anniversary compilation ‘Arquitectura del Sueño’, along with a few tracks appearing on Rhythm Büro’s previous VA releases.

RB004 opens on the A1 with a track entitled ‘The Key’ which is one of the first tracks made by Na Nich. The listener is gently introduced to an ambient wonder wall before some percussive elements open up and synths set the mood: a transportive journey led by a kalimba-infused melody which swells with a certain ambiguity that seems to lend a shamanistic touch. A2’s ‘DVA’ is a more four-to-the-floor dubbed-out gentle fist pumper, with melting synth melodies and foggy layers backdropped by steady reaching high-hats and a consistently wise kick drum. A strong element of the psychedelic and inquisitive is much present.

The B side of the record is another part of the story: B1's ‘Log’ is an epic night-finisher dreamscape, a strong element of space seems to be the focus here as beats play less present in this foggy cinematic soundtrack to a film that has yet to be made. The remix version by Luigi Tozzi on B2 reminds us how deep this prolific Italian artist can take us down the rabbit hole. For fans of danceable, groove-centered and though provoking tunes to loose one's and find one's mind to."	720258	all		654476712	playlist		2018-11-30T14:03:25Z	all-rights-reserved	47	False	na-nich-the-key-ep-rhythm-buro-004	https://soundcloud.com/sunchase/sets/na-nich-the-key-ep-rhythm-buro-004	True		https://www.decks.de/track/na_nich-the_key_ep/cdm-w1	2018-11-30T00:00:00Z	10		public	"""rhythm buro"" ""na nich"" ""the key"" ""luigi tozzi"""	Na Nich - The Key EP [ Rhythm Büro 004 ]	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/654476712	2792	ep	True	2018-11-30T14:03:25Z	2018-11-30T14:03:25Z	4	537762714,537762690,537762678,537762660

This time it's the label boss himself - Sunchase, who delivers this three track EP of juicy beats. While Alexander is busy exploring different genres in recent times, this release is a perfect reminder of that he is still one of the finest breakbeat masters in eastern Europe.

So Sweet wastes no time to get you started on the positive vibrations with its tight drums and flowing bassline. Double bass and trademark percussion sounds add a nice touch of warmth to the groove. It's just like the lady sings - so sweet when he starts rhythm!

When We Are Alone is pure love. Lush chords, intricate break work and deep bass touch your soul in a way only Sunchase's drum'n'bass can do. It's an elegant and intimate vibe that makes your body move just as well, so expect to hear this at lots of venues around the world very soon.

Why Are We Here mysterious and hypnotizing nature grabs your attention immediately and does not let go until the very end putting you into a sweet state of wonder. This piece retains its edginess without losing any depth and attention to detail, which is no mean feat and is definitely a worthy addition to any playlist."	446366	all	Drum & Bass	504419469	playlist	2222 Records	2018-04-23T15:03:08Z	all-rights-reserved	74	False	when-we-are-alone-ep	https://soundcloud.com/sunchase/sets/when-we-are-alone-ep	True		https://fanlink.to/Kcb	2018-04-23T00:00:00Z	19		public	2222 22:22 22-22 sunchase	When We Are Alone EP	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/504419469	2792		False	2018-04-23T15:01:06Z	2018-04-23T15:01:06Z	3	433937712,433937700,433937694

Infos :

Faces Records proudly presents ""Cross Section"", the debut album of  Kez YM, the Berlin based japanese producer.
It's been a long way since  his debut EP at 4Lux Recordings was played by Moodyman back in 2008. Since then he also received support from influential people like Theo Parrish, Rick Wade and Cassy, just to name a few.
Strongly rooted on his Detroit/Chicago Deep House/Funk/Disco/Afro he rocks dancefloors from Berlin to Tokyo, and he's one of the current leading deep house dj's from Japan.
From downbeat to more uptempo tracks, this album is a perfect extension of Kez's path until now. Classy and lustful synths pave the way for a combination of elements that draw inspiration from his jazz masters, his motorcity heroes and a strong percusssive connection to Africa.
You know what? Just let yourself go and enjoy the ride.

All tracks written & produced by Kazuki Yamaguchi.
Mastered by Ugly Drums.

We have a rich schedule of releases for the next months and this is the first gift after the holidays.
""Oh set me free"" was one of the hottest and played track of our sampler ""3 Years of Paul's Boutique"" so we decide to release it as a single,this time with a pair of brilliant remixes: the first comes from a very well known french duo Jef K and Gwen Maze,fresh from their recent release on Cecille,
who gaves their deepest touch to the track,while newcomer italian talent DJ Kool Dek (Area Remote,Saved,Be As One) adds his crazy and sneaky-beats! Last but not least,Luca himself reworked the original putting some new elements in the""Re-grooved mix"".
We're goin' to release this one in vinyl as well,so ,if you like it, feedbacks & charts are very important to us.: THANK YOU!"	970971	all	House	1142324	playlist	Paul's Boutique Records	2015-10-13T13:56:16Z	all-rights-reserved	3	False	psb018-luca-marano-oh-set-me	https://soundcloud.com/luca-marano/sets/psb018-luca-marano-oh-set-me	True		http://www.deejay.de/#/Luca_Marano_Oh_Set_Me_Free__82459	2011-09-30T00:00:00Z	1		public	PSB018 Luca Marano Oh Set Me Free Incl Jef K Gwen Maze Dj Kool Dek Remixes	PSB018 Luca Marano - Oh Set Me Free Incl.

For this release Franjazzco combined his enthusiasm for Jazz, Soul and Disco with a weighty Footwork/Juke kit, resulting in three deadly 160bpm anthems. 
On the flipside Sun People deployed a more UK-influenced style with references to 90s Jungle and UK Garage. Imagine Tek9 meets Duncan Powell meets DJ Spinn.

The EP is already receiving support by DJ Rashad, Distal, Chrissy Murderbot, DJ Clent, Rp Boo, Soulphiction, Phono, Scratcha DVA and others.

1924	https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000151239181-rup0zm-large.jpg	2016-03-17T03:09:27Z	"Starting his musical journey at itch fm with UK Veteran Disorda in 2001, Ghost went on to host his own radio show for 5 years in a time considered a golden era for UK Hip Hop. In 2003 Ghost released his first record, the 'Ghost Stories EP'. Over the next 6 years followed 4 videos, 3 albums Seldom Seen often Heard (2006), ‘Freedom of Thought’ (2009), ‘Postcards From The Edge’ (2011), 4 EP's, a 7"" single, a mix CD, guest production and remix work for the likes of Verb T, Kashmere (Strange U), Bonobo, The Heavy, Nicole Willis and the Soul Investigators. 

Ghost is one of a handful of UK artists to have his music licensed in Japan; this led to 2 album releases for Japanese markets only.
New album 'Shards of Memories' marks the 10 year anniversary since the release of Ghost’s critically acclaimed debut album ‘Seldom Seen Often Heard’.

Over the years Ghost has carved out a sound which is very much his own, thoughtful emotive laden Hip Hop beats and Instrumentals. Not just loops but heavily composed arrangements drawing the listener in to the music, multiple listens are required to hear everything that’s going on. On ‘Shards’ Ghost continues his own journey with a mix of past and contemporary Hip Hop sounds, live instrumentation, a hint of orchestral and blues vibes. Ghost has pulled together another masterful soundtrack. The key focus was to give the listener a journey through the album. This isn’t a mish mash of guest features that don't work as a collection of music. An album is a true test of any artist; an album takes time, planning and patience. And creativity.

‘Shards of Memories’ features the cream of UK Rap including Cappo, Verb T, Joker Starr, Benny Diction, Kal Sereousz and Efeks. It features two of Dublin’s finest in G.I. and Lethal Dialect, plus Australian legend Brad Strut and Aeryz from NZ. In keeping with a Ghost tradition the album also features 3 instrumental tracks, a style which earned Ghost much praise for his mostly instrumental 2nd album 'Freedom of Thought'.

To make the project even more unique Ghost created all 3 music videos by himself to mark this 10 year anniversary. Cutting his teeth making the ‘Prawns’ music video for Dirty Dike’s recent album and videos for Aussie heavyweight Briggs, Ghost show’s his creative side extends beyond music, now a talented director, cameraman and editor working as a freelance Creative Video Production freelancer."	3446167	all	Hip-hop & Rap	206483324	playlist	photosbyghost	2016-04-18T00:04:41Z	all-rights-reserved	9	False	ghost-shards-of-memories	https://soundcloud.com/musicbyghost/sets/ghost-shards-of-memories	True		http://ghost.bandcamp.com	2016-04-18T00:00:00Z	2		public	"""Hip Hop"" ""uk hip hop"" ""indie hip hop"" beats"	Ghost - Shards of Memories	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/206483324	2942		False		2016-03-17T03:09:27Z	16	252272098,252272088,252272068,252272058,252272039,252272029,252272021,252272011,252271996,252271985,252271968,252271950,252271934,252271923,252271902,252271879

The play explores ideas of religious beliefs, identity and hypocrisy in today's urban landscape using text, gestures, images and sounds in a solo performance. Set amidst the backdrop of 90's in India it evokes long forgotten memories, in search of an answer to things that have formed his views in today's time.

Bringing influences into the studio from various artists such as Chris Lorenzo, My Nu Leng, Hannah Wants, Toyboy & Robin, Mak & Pasteman, Alesso, Sebastian Ingrosso and Zedd you’ll be impressed with the quality of productions from this very talented duo set to blow up on the Underground club scene.

phD (Phonetic Deep) are proud to bring you Ely Hess and his Understand EP.

Ely Hess is a 19 year old producer based in Denver, Colorado. His love for electronic music started from playing around with synthesizers in his friends’ basement.

At at very young age Ely decided to pursue electronic music himself and began producing various forms of Electro-influenced House music. After much experimentation, he eventually fell in love with the Deep House being influenced by artists such as Low Steppa, Chris Lorenzo, Chris Gresswell, Dusky and Motez.

After religiously following the UK music scene, Ely’s goal has been to spread his underground sounds to the USA.

2015 is shaping up to be a good year for the young and up-and-coming producer from America.

CUB & Ponc are a dance music duo from Brighton that have been making music together since they were kids. Venturing into many different styles throughout the years, they’re most comfortable with making Deep Techno infused House beats.

Taking inspiration from artists such as Diplo, My Nu Leng, Taiki Nulight and Sonny Fodera, they use them for influences when in the studio.

Alongside the dance music alias both Billy (CUB) and Will (PONC) have been heavily involved in the beat making for hip hop trio AOA. As a duo, this is CUB & Ponc’s first release and together with their amount of library music, they’re fast becoming a force to be reckoned with. 

Keep your eyes peeled for Cub & Ponc as they’re creating some serious dance vibes and quickly cementing their place in the dance music scene.

Digging now even deeper into the past of the musical journey of this label gave me a better insight, how music can transform and evolve through time. I happily re-discovered some tracks that I once loved but forgot and even discovered some new ones.

The practice of selecting songs and curating this third compilation made me realise once more, how unique each musical piece is by itself. The diversity of sounds within these tracks is almost endless and the more you zoom into a track, the more things you may discover that you never heard there before. Some hidden bleep, rustle or texture that you can only hear if you listen closely, these are the things on a musical journey that totally fascinate me.

Every one of us will have different emotions and memories connected to these songs. Let's revive these feelings and create some new ones at the same time. Let‘s zoom into the present, the place and time where all sounds, feelings and emotions lie.

Downtown Party Network – Disco Ball Drama
FBR026

A1. Disco Ball Drama
AA1. Keep On Running
AA2. No Drama Afterhours

Vinyl - available from July 11th
Digital - available from July 28th

Downtown Party Network already come with an excellent pedigree of disco licked tunes for quality imprints like Eskimo, Is It Balearic? Recordings and Dirt Crew. And so the debut appearance on Futureboogie seems like a most comfortable fit, with the ‘Disco Ball Drama’ extended player providing three shining examples of delicious grooves.

Title cut, ‘Disco Ball Drama’ cuts a familiar beat with a rolling and gritty acid-like arpeggio, the classy pads smoothing out the rougher edges and providing huge swashes of sunshine moments on this real mid-season winner.

‘Keep On Running’ on the flip side turns out a heads down, boogie-fest, with its elastic bassline, deep Rhodes chords and lively percussion doing the business here.

Closing the release is ‘No Drama Afterhours’, going down the cosmic alley for a slightly deeper cut. Spatial pads and looping syth arps gently collide over the swinging disco drums whilst the bass plays out an infectious melody, one for the ‘afterhours’ indeed."	855066	all	downtown party network	43027934	playlist	Futureboogie	2015-10-13T14:55:36Z	all-rights-reserved	172	False	downtown-party-network-disco-1	https://soundcloud.com/dpn/sets/downtown-party-network-disco-1	True		http://www.juno.co.uk/products/downtown-party-network-disco-ball-drama/539757-01	2014-07-11T00:00:00Z	39		public	futureboogie house Disco vinyl	Downtown Party Network - Disco Ball Drama EP [Futureboogie]	https://api.soundcloud.com/playlists/43027934	3110	ep	True		2014-07-10T12:44:06Z	3	158098165,158098644,158098956

TITLE A Journey
CAT# NT111
STYLE Deep House, Garage

1. Forgiveness
2. Let It Out
3. A Journey
4. How We Roll 
5. The Love You Keep
6. A New Dawn

The London legend Finest Wear returns to NT with a heavy hitting six-track EP. His latest sonic adventure takes the listener on A Journey through his love for all things deep -- sit back and enjoy. 

On his first release of 2021, Finest Wear goes back to his roots. The ep opens with Forgiveness, a deep & moody vocal cut-up with a soulful groove. Let It Out takes you on a trip to those peak-time dancefloor moments lost in the music. One highlight of the ep is A Journey: a lush, chilled-out soundscape built in waves – evolving, peaking and eventually fading like a fine sunset. Beautiful stuff. How We Roll kicks up the tempo with a driving groove and deadly hook, setting things up for the familiar garage vibes of The Love You Keep. Finally closing things out with New Dawn, an old-school track with a tip of the hat to ‘90s Chicago house. 

Blurring the lines between deep house, techno and garage in his productions, Finest Wear is the production moniker of London producer & deejay Cenzo Scoglio. Under his various aliases (Finest Wear, MrCenzo, MididropMusic) Cenzo has releases on BBE, Colour & Pitch, Kolour Recordings, Plastic City, Loudeast, UM Records, and Black Soul to name a few. Among others, he released two projects on Chicago’s legendary Large Music in 2017, which filled the deep house charts and found support from Sebb Junior, Demarkus Lewis, Saison, Nacho Marco and Souldynamic among others.

Past Finest Wear productions for Nordic Trax have been supported by the likes of Crackazat, Joris Voorn, Groove Armada, Danny Tenaglia, Jamie Jones, DJ T, Radio Slave, Franck Roger, John Digweed, Danny Howells, Claptone and many more.

CAT# NT110
STYLE Deep House

1. Can’t Hold Back (Main Mix)
2. Can’t Hold Back (Delerious Dub)
3. Prism
4. Keep It Hot
5. Vibes N Dub

Jon Delerious is back with his first release on the label since the 2018 hit Let’s Work. The Calgary producer goes deep with a five-track ep full of lush vibes and built around Jon’s infectious grooves.

Opening up the release Delerious delivers two feel good mixes of Can’t Hold Back. The title track is a catchy big-room anthem with elements of funk and soul that builds into an uplifting summertime vibe -- perfect for late nights & early mornings. On Prism & Keep It Hot the Canadian producer returns to his West Coast house roots with dub elements, acid basslines and slick percussion. Finally on Vibes N Dub, Delerious slows things down with a chilled-out track reminiscent of the best ‘90s downtempo.

Jon’s last release for Nordic Trax [Let’s Work, NT094] was his best-selling release on the label after 20 years on the scene! The title track reached the deep house Top 20 on Beatport and Traxsource and received widespread support from the likes of Groove Armada, Nick Warren, Kyodai, Jamie Trench, Pawas, Rob Da Bank, Kid Enigma, The Revenge, Giom, Danny Tenaglia and more.

Jon Delerious has six previous EPs on Nordic Trax, as well as the critically-acclaimed album 'No Warning' [2004]. Jon’s dub-influenced house has caught the eye of deejays and tastemakers alike, ending-up perhaps most notably as the lead track on Lee Burridge’s Global Underground compilation. More recently he's released music for Large Music, Tilted, Lost My Dog, Soulstar, Llama Farm and Sidetrak among others.

A native of Calgary, Jon Delerious is a regular on the Western Canadian music scene and has been playing the infamous Shambhala Music festival since its inception. Alongside many club gigs and residencies in his home town, Jon is the 'go-to' dj for touring royalty having opened for everyone from Kevin Saunderson to Ben Watt. He hosts a weekly broadcast from his studio on twitch with a loyal following from around the globe.

TITLE New Beginnings (feat @JT-Donaldson Remix)
CAT# NT108
STYLE Deep House

1. New Beginnings (JT Donaldson Remix)
2. New Beginnings (Main Mix)
3. New Beginnings (Radio Mix)
4. New Beginnings (Club Organ Edit)

It’s a family affair as three of our favourite artists return to the label with New Beginnings – an uplifting jazzy house track with a powerful message for the times. 

Producer Sean Dimitrie is back on Nordic Trax with vocalist & fellow Vancouverite Tim Fuller. The two have been a part of the Vancouver scene since the ‘90s and have collaborated on some classic tunes for the likes of Bombay, Odori and Salted Music. They recently performed a live PA at our 100th release party where this song first caught our attention. 

With three killer versions from Sean in the can, we dialed-up our old friend JT Donaldson for remix duty. And with the help of bass player Max Gerl & his own skills on the MPC, the Dallas producer took the track to another level: dropping a top-shelf jazzy house workout with an impeccable groove. 

JT Donaldson is one of the finest US house producers of his generation. He has hundreds of producing & writing credits on some seminal labels, including early on Fair Park, Cajual & Aesoteric and later the iconic Large Music, Seasons and Om Records to name a few. In 2000 we released the legendary The Quiet Life EP he produced with Chris Nazuka (NT012), and JT has also graced us with some high quality remixes over the years – including standouts for Gavin Froome & Joe Silva.

Sean’s history with the label runs deep to Vancouver in the mid-90s where he met label head Luke McKeehan and eventually wound up on our very first release in 1997 as Hide’n’Seek! A classically trained jazz guitarist, Sean’s career in music spans over two decades with releases on Deepen Discs, Leaf, Reverberations & more.

CAT# NT107
STYLE Deep House

1. New Seeds
2. In Da Beat
3. Broad Sweep

We’re excited to welcome rising producer Marotti to the Nordic Trax family. For his label debut, the French producer and deejay drops New Seeds -- a sensational three-track EP of deep and funky house.

The title track introduces Marotti to the world with a hypnotic groove that gets to work straight out of the gate. New Seeds bumps with swirling chords, a driving bass and an uplifting vocal all floating over a swinging beat. In Da Beat continues the stellar vibe with a deep-rhodes number that rises to the end with lovely key solos. Rounding out the release, Broad Sweep is one for the heads with a dreamy, chilled-out soundscape perfect for late nights & early mornings.

Jean Pierre Marotti, aka Marotti, is originally from Rennes and is of a French and Italian background. He made his way to house music after a dedicated upbringing full of funk, jazz & disco. He’s released on Rutilance Recordings, Stereophonk Records and his own label Meso Records. His work has been supported by Mark Farina, Groove Assassin, Sartorial and more. He recently remixed NT fave Demarkus Lewis for Smashing Trax. Keep an eye out for Marotti and watch the new seeds grow.

ARTIST Chris Udoh
TITLE All The Pieces Fit
CAT# NT106
STYLE Deep House, Deep Tech

1. Everlasting
2. All The Pieces Fit
3. Soft Whisper
4. Quarantine Deep

Philadelphia producer Chris Udoh (Wamdue Kids, Tigerhook) makes his long-overdue return to Nordic Trax with a four-track ep of deep, tech vibes.

The four tracks on All The Pieces Fit follow in the tradition of Chris Udoh’s impeccable production standards -- built and refined over three decades in the scene as a successful producer and deejay. Drifting between big room tech house and deeper, late-night moments, this release will hit all the right notes for the discerning listeners out there.

Originally from St. Louis, it wasn’t until Chris moved to Atlanta and teamed-up with Deep C & Chris Brann as the Wamdue Kids that his recognition grew beyond the Eastern US. The trio toured the circuit and had a string of successful releases on seminal labels Peacefrog, Guidance, Studio !K7 and Nite Grooves to name a few.

Based in Philly since ’96, Chris Udoh’s solo work and collaborations have been equally as prolific as his early Wamdue outings, including stand-out releases on Siesta, Worship, Hooj Chons, Saw Recordings, Shaboom and of course Nordic Trax (Breeze In The Night, 2004). He was a resident of Fabric for several years in the ‘00s (with Deep C as Tigerhook) and remains busy in the studio with remixes and original productions continuing to flow.

ARTIST Demarkus Lewis @demarkuslewis
TITLE Emotional Landslide
CAT# NT105
RELEASE May 15, 2020

Demarkus Lewis returns to Nordic Trax with a blazing three-track ep of his signature deep house. In his third outing on the label, the Dallas producer pulls no punches delivering an emotional release of underground goodness.

The three track Emotional Landslide EP features two mixes of the title track; an uplifting groover built around a swinging hook and Demarkus’ airtight drum programming. Amen Buddah follows a driving kick and his signature beats that falls somewhere in between tech house & garage, quite refreshing.

He’s been called ""the hardest working man in House"" and in 2014 Demarkus Lewis was the #1 Jackin' House Artist on Traxsource. But the term ‘jackin’ doesn’t really do his style justice. The versatile producer is equally known for his deep & soulful excursions, including his stand-out collaboration with vocalist Martha Wash ‘Look To The Light’.

Fans of the label will no doubt be familiar with Demarkus Lewis, he released a pair of high quality eps on Nordic Trax: Make It Mellow (NT031, 2003) & Parallels (NT037, 2004). The Dallas producer has been a staple since he burst on the scene in 1999. His epic discography is jammed with classics on some of the finest labels including Nervous, Kingstreet Sounds, Slip n Slide, Salted, Large Music, Aesoteric, Guesthouse, Doin’ Work and his own label Grin Music.
